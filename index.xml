two key limitations cannot control for extraneous variables cannot be easily replicated ethical concerns: often not practical to get informed consent + debrief quasi and natural experiments participants are not randomly allocated to conditions in quasi-experiments participants are grouped based on a trait or behaviour eg one group has depression and one does not other common IVs used include gender, culture, age natural experiments are a subset of quasi experiments refers to an independent variable that in environmental in nature and outside of the control of the researcher most natural experiments work on a pre-test, post-test design; behaviour is measured both before and after the variable was introduced both do not show direct causation, but they are able to imply a causal relationship between IV and DV correlational studies take place when an experiment cannot be carried out, but data are collected which show a relationship between two variables when one variable changes, another variable changes with it a positive correlation is when both variables are affected in the same way; as x increases y increases a negative correlations means that as one variable increases, the other decreases no independent variable is manipulated, so no cause and effect relationship can be determined bidirectional ambiguity is seen in correlational research; since no independent variable is manipulated, it is impossible to know if x causes y or vice versa, or if it&amp;rsquo;s coincidental or due to a third variable factors to consider when evaluating experiments [[notes/psych/research method/variables#identifying extraneous and/or confounding variables|extraneous and confounding variables]] - undesirable variables that influence the relationship between the DV and IV demand characteristics occur when participants act differently simply because they know they&amp;rsquo;re in a study; they might try to guess the aims of the study and act accordingly expectancy effect: the participant attempts to discern the experimenter&amp;rsquo;s hypotheses with the goal of &amp;ldquo;helping&amp;rdquo; the researcher screw you effect: participant attempts to discern the experimenter&amp;rsquo;s hypotheses, but only in order to destroy the credibility of the study social desirability effect: participant answers in a way that makes them look good to the researcher, to avoid embarrassment or judgement researcher bias when experimenter sees what they&amp;rsquo;re looking for; the expectations of the researcher consciously or unconsciously affect the findings of the study avoided by using [[notes/psych/research method/variables#single/double blind procedures|double blind procedures]] participant variability a limitation of a study when the characteristics of the sample affect the DV can be controlled through [[notes/psych/research method/types of sampling#random sampling|random sampling]] and random allocation artificiality when situation created is so unlikely to occur that one has to wonder if there is any validitiy in the findings qualitative research methods used to produce descriptive data which is used to gain an understanding of underlying reasons, opinions, and motivations for an individual or group&amp;rsquo;s behaviour research generally takes place in natural settings normally guided by one or more research questions; an open ended question which invites detailed descriptions, and if possible explanations goal: not to identify cause and effect, but rather to describe the meanings attributed to events by the research participants themselves use an inductive approach - researchers don&amp;rsquo;t normally define variables in advance because this might express the researcher&amp;rsquo;s ideas more than the participant&amp;rsquo;s.</description></item><item><title>random phrases</title><link>https://axeolotl69.github.io/stalactite/notes/jpn/vocab/random-phrases/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://axeolotl69.github.io/stalactite/notes/jpn/vocab/random-phrases/</guid><description>になればと思っている。i wish i could

a participant in the other condition(s) on one or more participant variables of relevance to the experiment eg two people of the same height are split into control and one goes to experimental or treatment advantages: no order effects, participant loss is less common disadvantages: difficult to know which variables to match, pre-testing can create order effects, time consuming, loss of one participant means attrition of their pairs/trios etc repeated measures design same group of participants are exposed to two or more conditions and the conditions are compared aka &amp;ldquo;in subject&amp;rdquo; designs advantages: can effectively control potential confounding variables disadvantages: [[notes/psych/research method/variables#order effect|order effect]] where participants may get used to conditions (use [[notes/psych/research method/variables#counterbalancing|counterbalancing]] to&amp;hellip;counter this) cross-sectional studies compares different groups of participants on one or more variables of interest at a single point in time all data collected at the same time or within a short time frame not true experiments because participants cannot be randomly allocated to groups advantages: used to effectively study change over time, simple, less time consuming, less expensive disadvantages: cause-effect between variables cannot be fully tested, very little control over extraneous variables, cohort effect (where groups are born in significantly different times, and members of each group have shared life experiences relating to social or cultural events;

mother and father died, other relatives/guardians either deceased or far away father was orinthologist (study of birds) and fortunately passed away before said birds were disappeared mc describes how when the brids were disappeared, their absence were felt, even when she was looking straight at a bird item loses meaning and purpose, rather than physical form after his death, memory police ransack his office in search for things, presumably bird related, to dispose of chapter 3 mc’s occupation as a writer introduced to old man, her nurse’s husband, who lives in an old boat chapter 4 15 years since memory police first appeared memory police arresting four people introduced to R, her editor rumour that memory police are assessing genetic traits and links about those who can remember things which have been disappeared introduces first aspect of political themes, how those in power intend to control everything including what is and isn’t remembered foreshadowing the disappearing of words/text, which is the backbone of mc’s career and life chapter 5 inui family appear at mc’s doorstep, asking to return her mother’s sculptures they’re about to go into a safehouse because the memory police have summoned them they vanish at the end of the chapter we learn that mc’s mother also received a summon from memory police, and once she followed them she only came back dead chapter 6 introduction to mc’s current manuscript, girl with typewriter flowers are disappeared end of chapter mc can’t imagine what a flower looks like anymore everyone is desensitised to things being disappeared they don’t even seem sad/distraught/confused about it chapter 7 the ferry was disappeared a while ago and we learn that the old man, who was a sailor or smth, wasn’t even upset about it just kinda feels empty chapter 8 we read more about mc’s writing, and the girl inside the story having such a lovely relationship with her typewriter teacher… mc and R talk about the script, then her mother and father mc brings R to the basement where her mother kept all these items that were disappeared R reveals that he remembers everything chapter 9 memory police have become more brutal, with no warning before taking people away people vanishing has become more common mc tells the old man about R, asking for help to hide him they begin making the room ready for R to live in, concern and nervousness weighing on mc’s mind chapter 10 they bring R to the house with some elaborate (but worth it) plan he goes into the basement wow!</description></item><item><title>the shivering - task</title><link>https://axeolotl69.github.io/stalactite/notes/eng/book-notes/the-thing-around-your-neck/the-shivering-task/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://axeolotl69.github.io/stalactite/notes/eng/book-notes/the-thing-around-your-neck/the-shivering-task/</guid><description>Style – HOW Identify the author’s key storytelling strategies
