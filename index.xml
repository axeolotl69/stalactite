a participant in the other condition(s) on one or more participant variables of relevance to the experiment eg two people of the same height are split into control and one goes to experimental or treatment advantages: no order effects, participant loss is less common disadvantages: difficult to know which variables to match, pre-testing can create order effects, time consuming, loss of one participant means attrition of their pairs/trios etc repeated measures design same group of participants are exposed to two or more conditions and the conditions are compared aka &amp;ldquo;in subject&amp;rdquo; designs advantages: can effectively control potential confounding variables disadvantages: [[notes/psych/research method/variables#order effect|order effect]] where participants may get used to conditions (use [[notes/psych/research method/variables#counterbalancing|counterbalancing]] to&amp;hellip;counter this) cross-sectional studies compares different groups of participants on one or more variables of interest at a single point in time all data collected at the same time or within a short time frame not true experiments because participants cannot be randomly allocated to groups advantages: used to effectively study change over time, simple, less time consuming, less expensive disadvantages: cause-effect between variables cannot be fully tested, very little control over extraneous variables, cohort effect (where groups are born in significantly different times, and members of each group have shared life experiences relating to social or cultural events; think gen z vs gen x)</description></item><item><title>ted talk - chimamanda ngozi adichie (author)</title><link>https://axeolotl69.github.io/stalactite/notes/eng/book-notes/the-thing-around-your-neck/ted-talk-chimamanda-ngozi-adichie-author/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://axeolotl69.github.io/stalactite/notes/eng/book-notes/the-thing-around-your-neck/ted-talk-chimamanda-ngozi-adichie-author/</guid><description> chimamanda speaks of how there is never truly one story for a person, place or time, but even so we are often exposed to a singular perspective which shapes our vision on the world her american roommate who only knew one story of africa, like many others, who was surprised that chimamanda could speak english and read and use a stove when she was surprised that the brother of her house cleaner was able to create a woven basket, she realised she only ever had one story about their family - that they were poor having multiple stories increases our dignity, she says, and our understanding of the world i assume this is why her novel &amp;ldquo;the thing around your neck&amp;rdquo; contains twelve stories from different perspectives of people from nigeria, to allow us to have a good understanding of it</description></item><item><title>terra nullius</title><link>https://axeolotl69.github.io/stalactite/notes/eng/book-notes/terra-nullius/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://axeolotl69.github.io/stalactite/notes/eng/book-notes/terra-nullius/</guid><description>chapter 1 introduced to setting…somewhat two seperate povs kind of: one of the “natives” and the “settlers” we meet jacky, a native, who ran?</description></item><item><title>the memory police</title><link>https://axeolotl69.github.io/stalactite/notes/eng/book-notes/the-memory-police/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://axeolotl69.github.io/stalactite/notes/eng/book-notes/the-memory-police/</guid><description>chapter 1 introduces setting, loss of memory, and how some can retain it mc’s mother shows a few items which have been “disappeared” and explains each item to her daughter mc is unable to fathom the concept of each item, hence “disappearance” chapter ends with foreshadowing and mc asking her mother why she can remember these things chapter 2 mc has little to no family left; mother and father died, other relatives/guardians either deceased or far away father was orinthologist (study of birds) and fortunately passed away before said birds were disappeared mc describes how when the brids were disappeared, their absence were felt, even when she was looking straight at a bird item loses meaning and purpose, rather than physical form after his death, memory police ransack his office in search for things, presumably bird related, to dispose of chapter 3 mc’s occupation as a writer introduced to old man, her nurse’s husband, who lives in an old boat chapter 4 15 years since memory police first appeared memory police arresting four people introduced to R, her editor rumour that memory police are assessing genetic traits and links about those who can remember things which have been disappeared introduces first aspect of political themes, how those in power intend to control everything including what is and isn’t remembered foreshadowing the disappearing of words/text, which is the backbone of mc’s career and life chapter 5 inui family appear at mc’s doorstep, asking to return her mother’s sculptures they’re about to go into a safehouse because the memory police have summoned them they vanish at the end of the chapter we learn that mc’s mother also received a summon from memory police, and once she followed them she only came back dead chapter 6 introduction to mc’s current manuscript, girl with typewriter flowers are disappeared end of chapter mc can’t imagine what a flower looks like anymore everyone is desensitised to things being disappeared they don’t even seem sad/distraught/confused about it chapter 7 the ferry was disappeared a while ago and we learn that the old man, who was a sailor or smth, wasn’t even upset about it just kinda feels empty chapter 8 we read more about mc’s writing, and the girl inside the story having such a lovely relationship with her typewriter teacher… mc and R talk about the script, then her mother and father mc brings R to the basement where her mother kept all these items that were disappeared R reveals that he remembers everything chapter 9 memory police have become more brutal, with no warning before taking people away people vanishing has become more common mc tells the old man about R, asking for help to hide him they begin making the room ready for R to live in, concern and nervousness weighing on mc’s mind chapter 10 they bring R to the house with some elaborate (but worth it) plan he goes into the basement wow!</description></item><item><title>thérèse raquin</title><link>https://axeolotl69.github.io/stalactite/notes/eng/book-notes/th%C3%A9r%C3%A8se-raquin/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://axeolotl69.github.io/stalactite/notes/eng/book-notes/th%C3%A9r%C3%A8se-raquin/</guid><description>chapter 1 boring intro chapter 2 intro to therese, her cousin camille, and his mother camille in his childhood was often sick and his mother loved him lots and took care of him and sent him to a good school we learn that therese’s mother had died and her father dropped her off with her aunt (he refers to therese as “it” lol) and he dies later in africa therese is treated well!</description></item><item><title>to do list</title><link>https://axeolotl69.github.io/stalactite/notes/to-do-list/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://axeolotl69.github.io/stalactite/notes/to-do-list/</guid><description>jpn
