two key limitations cannot control for extraneous variables cannot be easily replicated ethical concerns: often not practical to get informed consent + debrief quasi and natural experiments participants are not randomly allocated to conditions in quasi-experiments participants are grouped based on a trait or behaviour eg one group has depression and one does not other common IVs used include gender, culture, age natural experiments - refers to an independent variable that in environmental in nature and outside of the control of the researcher most natural experiments work on a pre-test, post-test design; behaviour is measured both before and after the variable was introduced both do not show direct causation, but they are able to imply a causal relationship between IV and DV correlational studies take place when an experiment cannot be carried out, but data are collected which show a relationship between two variables when one variable changes, another variable changes with it a positive correlation is when both variables are affected in the same way; as x increases y increases a negative correlation means that as one variable increases, the other decreases no independent variable is manipulated, so no cause and effect relationship can be determined bidirectional ambiguity is seen in correlational research; since no independent variable is manipulated, it is impossible to know if x causes y or vice versa, or if it&amp;rsquo;s coincidental or due to a third variable factors to consider when evaluating experiments [[notes/psych/research method/variables#identifying extraneous and/or confounding variables|extraneous and confounding variables]] - undesirable variables that influence the relationship between the DV and IV demand characteristics occur when participants act differently simply because they know they&amp;rsquo;re in a study; they might try to guess the aims of the study and act accordingly expectancy effect: the participant attempts to discern the experimenter&amp;rsquo;s hypotheses with the goal of &amp;ldquo;helping&amp;rdquo; the researcher screw you effect: participant attempts to discern the experimenter&amp;rsquo;s hypotheses, but only in order to destroy the credibility of the study social desirability effect: participant answers in a way that makes them look good to the researcher, to avoid embarrassment or judgement researcher bias when experimenter sees what they&amp;rsquo;re looking for; the expectations of the researcher consciously or unconsciously affect the findings of the study avoided by using [[notes/psych/research method/variables#single/double blind procedures|double blind procedures]] participant variability a limitation of a study when the characteristics of the sample affect the DV can be controlled through [[notes/psych/research method/types of sampling#random sampling|random sampling]] and random allocation artificiality when situation created is so unlikely to occur that one has to wonder if there is any validitiy in the findings qualitative research methods used to produce descriptive data which is used to gain an understanding of underlying reasons, opinions, and motivations for an individual or group&amp;rsquo;s behaviour research generally takes place in natural settings normally guided by one or more research questions; an open ended question which invites detailed descriptions, and if possible explanations goal: not to identify cause and effect, but rather to describe the meanings attributed to events by the research participants themselves use an inductive approach - researchers don&amp;rsquo;t normally define variables in advance because this might express the researcher&amp;rsquo;s ideas more than the participant&amp;rsquo;s.</description></item><item><title>random phrases</title><link>https://axeolotl69.github.io/stalactite/notes/jpn/vocab/random-phrases/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://axeolotl69.github.io/stalactite/notes/jpn/vocab/random-phrases/</guid><description>になればと思っている。i wish i could
