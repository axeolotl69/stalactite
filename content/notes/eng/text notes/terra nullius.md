title: "terra nullius"
---

-   chapter 1
    -   introduced to setting…somewhat
    -   two seperate povs kind of: one of the “natives” and the “settlers”
    -   we meet jacky, a native, who ran?? somewhere. absconded. he was taken away from his family but remembers them, remembers he had a family and a home
    -   and some settlers who are determined to educate the souls of the natives “if they even had souls”
    -   we know the settlers think of natives as almost sub-human
-   chapter 2
    -   jacky continues running, “absconding”
    -   his only weapon is a kitchen knife he stole
    -   he remembers a little as he keeps running
-   chapter 3
    -   introduced to head of the department of the protection of natives, aka “devil”
        -   “i don’t need my real name anyways. names are for people to identify with. everyone already knows who i am.”
    -   he denies every request the natives present…asshole
    -   he hates the landscape here as he hates the natives, then choosing to replace his hate for the natives with pity, thinking of them as children who need to be saved
    -   also introduced to esperance, a second gen native born in camp
    -   she describes that everyone in their camp longs for a home they don’t have
    -   she wishes to go home, but this camp is the closest thing she has to “home”, so she doesn’t want to leave
-   chapter 4
    -   introduced to sargeant rohan, apprehensive to finding jacky
    -   he thinks that the natives should be grateful for living in these camps, rather than living “pointless, aimless lives in the dirt like they always had.”
    -   he thinks their only ambitions are to drink, breed, and escape
    -   he brings some men along with him to hunt and kill jacky; they all find some wicked pleasure in hunting natives like wild animals out of hate
    -   jacky ran into a nun who told him where to go oh no he forgot his shoes
-   chapter 5
    -   we meet johnny star, a settler who ran away and meets tucker, a native
    -   he assumes tucker doesn’t know english…he does
    -   explores the idea of the stolen children, how it’s easier to manipulate them when taken younger
-   chapter 6
    -   rohan and his men continue searching for jacky (failing)
-   chapter 7
    -   explores more of johnny’s group; tucker and others, where johnny is their leader
    -   explores how different johnny is from the natives around him; he doesn’t appreciate the food or the landscape, yet he still thinks the natives don’t deserve to be treated the way they are
    -   jacky…continues running
    -   someone stole some flour and rohan decides to blame it on jacky as an excuse
-   chapter 8
    -   sister bagra receives a letter from back home(?) that an investigator is being sent regarding claims that she’s mistreating the natives, along with the entire colony mistreating them
    -   she Does Not like this, saying that “anyone that has trained animals would surely know that only a firm hand can teach them” and “even little children must be disciplined” once again dehumanising them
    -   johnny is about to die of hunger BUT at least he has the power of friendship and doesn’t hate himself!!!
-   chapter 9
    -   jacky. is running.
    -   johnny and his gang share stories the depressing kind
    -   rohan asks “their” native for water. he finds water in a tree
    -   “their” native runs away at night. go him!
    -   ohhhh mel was the one who sent the letter about sister bagra
    -   someone informs esperance that rohan went into their camp looking for water probably
-   chapter 10
    -   the quote at the start is supposedly written in 2041, so we know terra nullius is like a dystopia based on the past…
-   chapter 11
    -   bagra decided to discipline all of the children rather than the individuals involved, because “they all looked the same to her” verbatim
        -   bcs of a few chapters ago (i forgot) where someone was hiding the fact that some natives ran away and they brought them back idk…
    -   bagra is blaming this on jacky, for breaking in, because those she is “taking care” of also aspire to have a home, and the nuns are doubting whether the children can be or should be tamed
    -   she strongly believes that the natives shouldn’t need to look for their other home because their home is right herre and she doesn’t understand why they want to look so badly
    -   she sends a letter to “devil” to hurry up catching jacky because apparently that’ll solve all her problems
-   chapter 12
    -   johnny star is Dying of dehydration, his gang has left him and he doesn’t know why because he’s currently delirious (either they abandoned him or are finding water)
    -   he mentioned how some troopers would rather kill themselves than die of dehydration, “dry death”, but he was too stubborn to do so—he believed, he hoped that water would come
    -   he starts thinking of his “home”, where it wasn’t dry
    -   he thinks of his childhood which he hated, for its intense structure and mental inflexibility
        -   bcs he was disobedient
        -   he was in fights often
    -   he was almost brought to jail then, and now thinks that “jail would have been the easier fate”
-   chapter 13
    -   jacky is still trying to find jerramungup
    -   he is Lost
    -   he meets johnny who is literally gasping for water
    -   he refers to him as Toad, as the natives refer to the settlers
    -   jacky wonders whether his kindness to johnny is out of trained compassion for settlers, or out of his own humanity
    -   johnny says thank you (a first for jacky, coming from a settler) and he resists calling him “master” as he is conditioned to
    -   now he’s looking for water
-   chapter 14
    -   esperance hopes for her family, her mob, to “learn to sing in harmony like the magpies”
    -   her plan is that if they were overrun by settlers, the last bullet in her gun was for herself….
    -   esperance speaks of a woman, livia, who was so badly traumatised she screamed a lot, often not completely conscious
    -   when she was conscious, her story was pieced together: she came from like a baby farm?? and they’d inject something so that all the women would give birth
    -   the new gen of farmed babies (i personally have chosen to call them this) were a lot more robotic, than the older gen. still human, yes, but esperance describes how nothing they do is unnecessary, while the older gen are much more rebellious—human
    -   and these new kids were all the same sickly white skin tone, like porcelain
    -   esperance’s grandfather, after hearing this story, taught her how to use the gun (without bullets as they had none to spare)
    -   esperance thinks the settlers value their livestock more than the natives (she’s probably right)
    -   jacky approaches johnny again, except johnny’s gang is back. when he gets closer, the gang asks why jacky didn’t kill him, when johnny was so helpless, why jacky didn’t rid the world of a settler. jacky explains that it was ********because******** he was so helpless, that jacky couldn’t kill him. johnny thanks him once again, and jacky describes him as human
-   chapter 15
    -   esperance’s grandfather tells the story of his experience with the invasion—then apologises to esperance that her grandmother died giving birth to her mother, and now esperance is the only one he has left. he disappears into the bush before esperance has a chance to tell him it’s not his fault
    -   bagra is (with an illegally downloaded program) looking through security cameras to try and find evidence that mel is up to no good. she is failing
    -   because mel shows more kindness to the natives than the other nuns did, bagra was suspicious of her, yet she couldn’t find any evidence that she was the one who had sent in the complaint mail
    -   she snoops around mel’s room, finds nothing, leaves
    -   jacky keeps talking of jerramungup in like a dreamy tone and everyone around him is telling him to shut up (/lh) and goes “we just need a map” but he knows it’s Not That Simple
    -   rohan learns from a native informant that johnny and jacky are working together now!! and that makes life harder for him since he believes johnny is able to hide them even more efficiently
    -   some random settler farmer told rohan she saw the star gang and they robbed her but because they had guns she and her husband did nothing. and now her husband is going to try and (illegally) hunt natives. which means there is a legal way to do it. anyways rohan has no choice but to report it (he is kind of sad about this)
    -   grark is being led through the breeding facility and is Disgusted, he wants to stop it but has to pretend that he is Not Disgusted
    -   he writes the report but remembers that mail takes a long time to send back but he sends it anyways cuz what choice does he have
    -   turns out he’s the investigator for bagra’s missionary
-   chapter 16
    -   johnny and gang have obtained map! yippee
    -   it’s very futuristic; a holo. johnny explains how he got rid of paper 2d maps and gps from rebel humans…seems like everywhere is rlly strict in this dystopia
    -   jacky asks why johnny isn’t “home”, johnny explains that he’d probably die if he was caught
    -   they reach jerramungup…to find that jacky’s parents both died from the invasion…
    -   jacky was originally named fred junior as his father was fred
    -   esperance wants to keep the mob moving incase the settlers find them, the elders would rather not
    -   her grandfather approves though, then tearfully explains the meaning behind her name: hope
    -   natives are rebelling because they’ve heard of jacky, and devil can’t shut up either side
    -   settlers (in a flier) found the star gang, but they kill the settlers. jacky still refuses to hold a gun
-   chapter 17
    -   rohan finds out johnny took down a flier
    -   the star gang have found what seems to be a mob untouched by the settlers (i believe it’s esperance’s group?)
    -   bagra is convincing grark that everything is ok!! i don’t think he believes her but he’s hiding that well!!
    -   johnny says he hates what he used to call his parents, since they didn’t care for him; the rest of the gang say the complete opposite, that they love their parents. tucker says that “you monsters” (referring to the settlers including johnny) “think we don’t care about our children so you can take them away) and johnny goes “while i regret that you lump me in with them…yes, we are monsters” (not verbatim)
    -   ******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************we put society first and family second, you are the opposite. yes, that makes us monsters compared to you.******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
    -   grark isn’t sure whether to believe bagra
    -   he hears the children sing, and bagra goes “they add some weird primitive thing called harmony. it’s so weird” but he thinks it’s beautiful
-   chapter 18
    -   i was right. star gang found esperance
    -   so esperance makes johnny “surrender” but like he would’ve done so anyways i presume
    -   yayyy friendsss woooo
    -   mel reveals to grark that the way children are treated in his presence is not in fact how they are treated normally. she explains the abuse. he asks her to testify. he asks if she was the one who had written the letter. she wasn’t. she wished she could, but she was too scared.
    -   uh oh!! esperance warns her camp that people are coming
-   chapter 19
    -   grark and bagra have a…lovely conversation. he reveals he has to go soon and bagra secretly triumphs
    -   mel wants to talk to him but bagra’s like “why?? DID YOU SEND THE LETTER”
    -   ok grark found evidence of 1. bagra hacking the system, using his own hack and 2. bagra scaring away mel. mel has left the institution and no one can find her
-   chapter 20
    -   um
    -   rohan finds the camp looking for jacky
    -   jacky reveals himself, stabs rohan with a knife
    -   and then jacky is shot. jacky is dead
    -   esperance uses all her shots—even the last one, meant for her—and johnny saves her from being killed by a settler. he tells her to run. “i would run too if i had something to live for”
    -   they find mel’s body. she’s dead from dehydration
    -   finally grark confronts bagra, and one of the older nuns revealed that she had sent the letter rather than mel
    -   grark W
    -   he talks to Devil and basically says “i’m gonna report you lol have fun!”
-   chapter 21
    -   grark is assassinated…
    -   esperance lives on
