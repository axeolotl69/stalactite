title: "ted talk - chimamanda ngozi adichie (author)"
---

- chimamanda speaks of how there is never truly one story for a person, place or time, but even so we are often exposed to a singular perspective which shapes our vision on the world
	- her american roommate who only knew one story of africa, like many others, who was surprised that chimamanda could speak english and read and use a stove
	- when she was surprised that the brother of her house cleaner was able to create a woven basket, she realised she only ever had one story about their family - that they were poor
- having multiple stories increases our dignity, she says, and our understanding of the world
- i assume this is why her novel "the thing around your neck" contains twelve stories from different perspectives of people from nigeria, to allow us to have a good understanding of it
