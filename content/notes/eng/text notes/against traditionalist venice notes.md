title: "against traditionalist venice notes"
---
1st para
- imagery that venice has been restricted
- inclusive language (throughout the whole text) suggests that marinetti is making himself a part of the people of venice, already implying that everyone is on the same side sharing beliefs and values
- stating what needs to be done rather than making it a question
- sophisticated language, used to intimidate the reader somewhat (more fancy language=well educated?)
- absence of introduction is very abrupt, upfront. opens with a gesture (we turn our backs)
2nd
- lots of sentences which allude to the same message/describe the same thing, in order to emphasise the point+leave less room for interpretation
- message: venice as it is, is wrong. it's polluted. snobbish. marinetti no like it
- lots of language surrounding sex (whores, bed worn out by endless droves of lovers) which has negative connotations, almost like saying venice is worn and used
- putting readers against traditionalism
3rd
- 
4th
- again, inclusive pronoun "we" leaving readers without doubt that they are included in this movement, and that marinetti is doing something in their interest
- paints the idea of industrialised venice (prepare for the birth of an industrial and military venice)
- use of word "birth" is associated with the female sex, as opposed to the "industrial and military" and "dominated" which is associated with a more masculine sex
- sentence included to be a more direct push, stating what the futurist movement desires
