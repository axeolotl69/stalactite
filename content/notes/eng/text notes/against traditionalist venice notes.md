title: "against traditionalist venice notes"
---
1st para
- imagery that venice has been restricted
- inclusive language (throughout the whole text) suggests that marinetti is making himself a part of the people of venice, already implying that everyone is on the same side sharing beliefs and values
- stating what needs to be done rather than making it a question
- sophisticated language, used to intimidate the reader somewhat (more fancy language=well educated?)
- absence of introduction is very abrupt, upfront. opens with a gesture (we turn our backs)
2nd
- lots of sentences which allude to the same message/describe the same thing, in order to emphasise the point+leave less room for interpretation
- message: venice as it is, is wrong. it's polluted. snobbish. marinetti no like it
- lots of language surrounding sex (whores, bed worn out by endless droves of lovers) which has negative connotations, almost like saying venice is worn and used
- putting readers against traditionalism
3rd
- presenting futurism and industrialism as a cure
- blurred line between the city referring to Venice and the city referring to Venetians
- either way, both are described negatively as if they *need* futurism
4th
- again, inclusive pronoun "we" leaving readers without doubt that they are included in this movement, and that marinetti is doing something in their interest
- paints the idea of industrialised venice (prepare for the birth of an industrial and military venice)
- use of word "birth" is associated with the female sex, as opposed to the "industrial and military" and "dominated" which is associated with a more masculine sex
- sentence included to be a more direct push, stating what the futurist movement desires
- nationalistic elements, "this great Italian lake"
5th
- proposing to take away what Venice is known for
- language of "rubble" and "crumbling" just pushes the notion that Venice is old, worn, and out of date 
6th
- theme of destruction towards old Venice
- rather than destroying though, it could be interpreted as "covering it up"
- you can tell he's biased, marinetti uses really nice adjectives for his proposal while using negative adjectives towards the Venice he wished to destroy
- before, the start of every paragraph was "We [...]" etc, present tense. but now, in this paragraph, he starts with "We'll", moving towards future tense. A sudden push for the movement
7th
- advocating that Venice should accept change, the "divine Electric Light"
- again, using the word "whorish" and "bedrooms" to describe an old and outdated Venice. bro rlly had no bitches
- imperative sentence usage "Let the reign blablabla" feels impersonal, along with the lack of inclusive pronouns (no We). like it's inevitable 
- sounds like a whole prophecy
