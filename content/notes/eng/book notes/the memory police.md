    -   old man came to live with mc
    -   they began fixing the house post-earthquake
    -   they find disappeared items inside mc’s mother’s statues; a harmonica, ramune candy, a ferry ticket
    -   mc remembers the sensation of the ferry ticket but not really the actual concept itself
    -   it seems like she wants to remember enough to satisfy R, while R just wants her to remember anything
    -   R brings her through the rest of the items, playing the harmonica and letting her have some ramune
    -   he tells her stories about the items
-   **chapter 23**
    -   mc and old man go to her mother’s cabin to bring back more items
    -   but oh no!! they’re checking bags at the train station!!
    -   old man says don’t worry i got this
    -   some woman collapses and that means the bag checks stop and they only have to collect papers
    -   phew!
    -   they’re eating but old man is out of it, as if he briefly lost consciousness
-   **chapter 24**
    -   they show R everything, he’s very happy about it
    -   “you two are the ones who need these memories, not me”
    -   the dog gets sick. just a minor infection he’s fine now
    -   old man gives R a haircut lol
    -   mc…talks with old man…for the last time… but she doesn’t know that :(
-   **chapter 25**
    -   wahhhh old man’s funeral :(
    -   he died of a hemorrhage in the brain caused during the earthquake
    -   mc found it hard to cope with this death specifically
    -   to cope with her anxiety/stress at night, mc looks and fiddles with the disappeared items, and occasionally there are brief moments where they would show her something more—but that was the extent of it
    -   she starts writing again, and for once actually writes something coherent!! yipee
    -   R is joyed by this
    -   …first disappearance since death of old man…left legs.
    -   literally it’s terrifying to read because mc treats it like a foreign parasite, unable to move it, unable to do anything with it. she can’t move her legs, can’t fathom the idea of walking with both, yet struggles to walk regardless. her right leg is still There and her left leg is still There but she knows she has a right leg but not her left leg and that’s freaky
    -   because usually things either disappear on their own, or everyone destroys it manually, everyone’s confused as to what to do. initially they think it’ll just rot and fall off, or they’ll have to chop it off, but this is similar to old man’s ferry in the sense that the object is still There, but its purpose and meaning has dissolved
    -   it’s also the first body part which is terrifying actually
    -   even the dog’s left back leg is unused
    -   R kisses the leg but she can barely feel it
-   **chapter 26**
    -   they grow accustomed to living “without legs” which scares me because your legs are right there??? you can still use them?? it’s like they’re paralysed but at least paralysed legs still hold meaning, but these don’t?? they’re like meaningless dangly things wtf
    -   it also means that ppl couldn’t hide if they remembered left legs, because it’s hard to fake a limp and stuff. which makes me wonder whether whoever the memory police are actually did this on purpose
    -   new communication with R’s wife: let the phone ring three times, three times back if R is doing well
    -   mc continues writing
    -   she feels sad about old man’s death, scared of losing her memories of him
    -   now right arms are disappeared! people not as scared because a limb has disappeared once before already…this terrifies me further because they’re already so desensitised to things disappearing even something so crucial to every day life
    -   something that i find interesting is this: mc says that she’ll soon be no longer able to get down to his room, because of limbs disappearing, and R says that it’s okay because he’ll carry her like a princess. but then she says “how can you hold something that’s not there?” and it means that she truly cannot fathom the idea of her limbs anymore. like even if they are right in front of her, they’re not ******there.****** and that is, once again, terrifying
    -   she describes each disappeared thing as illusions—her limbs aren’t really hers, they’re just shells
-   **chapter 27**
    -   in mc’s story again
    -   girl hears someone else coming up, but she doesn’t ask for help. why? because she’s dependent on the guy already, she’s scared of going outside
    -   and he knows that and uses that to his advantage, as he tries to steal another girl’s voice
    -   he brings someone else up the tower—the girl—and now the protagonist is saying “this is the final moment” but i have no clue what that means
-   ********************chapter 28********************
    -   i’m very surprised mc managed to write all of that, considering she’s now left handed and novels are disappeared
    -   “it’s fortunate that old man died before body parts were disappeared because i can still remember the feeling of his hand in mine” what if i sob
    -   more body parts are disappeared, some people are glad about fewer parts to manage…
    -   mc is worried about where her tears would go if cheeks disappeared LORD
    -   “the citizens of the island had lost everything that had a form, and our voices alone drifted endlessly.”
    -   everyone disappears. R climbs out of room. the end

**themes**
-   love
-   loss
-   memory
-   heirarchy

**questions**
-   who’s behind the disappearances? because clearly it’s both a mind thing _**and**_ a physical thing, if fruits and flowers and birds literally disappear, but also lose meaning to the individual
-   what makes mc’s mother and R different from everyone else? why can they remember but others can’t?
-   who’s in charge of the memory police; are they causing the disappearances or are they simply going along with it, treating it as some sort of religion?
-   why does mc never refer to old man by his name…unless he doesn’t have one?
-   is R really called R ..
-   and why is mc’s name never revealed? is it just not important
-   what significance do all these water metaphors have
-   it also means that ppl couldn’t hide if they remembered left legs, because it’s hard to fake a limp and stuff. which makes me wonder whether whoever the memory police are actually did this on purpose
-   are there any parallels from mc’s story which she was writing, and her and R’s story? because if so, does that mean R was the one disappearing things, to trap mc in the room with him…because when mc says she’s going to disappear, telling R to just leave her, he climbs out and shuts the door and rolls the rug?? is this a good thing or a bad thing i cannot tell what the fuck
-   at the end, did the memory police lose their form too? because mc never talked about that…were they just like everyone else. or did they remember things.

**thoughts**
-   i am terrified when they start losing limbs because things just lose Meaning and Purpose and what demonstrates this best are the disappearances of limbs
-   i have two opinions:
    -   one. memory police _**are**_ causing disappearances purposefully, a way to control everyone’s minds. one reason i say this is because they start to disappear things that’ll make it easier for them to find people who remember—books, limbs etc
    -   but then, why would they allow people’s bodies in their entireity to disappear? what is a nation without it’s people? and because of unreliable narration, we don’t know whether the memory police are also losing their bodies or not, so we don’t know if they remember or not. i think they _**do**_ remember, because they’re told to go and find and destroy things related to items which have been disappeared, but who knows? i also believe they’re just going along with the flow, believing this to be some sort of god-like event.
