## stages of memory
- these stages occur as a sequence
- they are interdependent on each other
### encoding
- process of converting information into usable form that can be stored
	- **automatic encoding** involves encoding information about location in space and time and frequency of experience
	- **effortful encoding** involves attending to information, labelling then associating it with other things in memory
- requires selective attention to the material being encoded
- **visual** encoding is the processing of images, **acoustic** encoding is the processing of sound (particularly of words), **semantic** encoding is the processing of meaning (of words)
### storage
- retention of information in memory over time
### retrieval
- process of locating and recovering stored info from memory so that we are consciously aware of it
- <u>not a random process</u>, involves various elements of cues, moods, schema, and is subject to errors
# multi-store model of memory (atkinson and shiffrin)
- proposed in 1968
- human memory is said to consist of three separate components
	- sensory
	- short-term
	- long-term
- these components are characterised by a specific duration and capacity
- certain conditions have to be met in order to make info move to the next memory-store

### sensory memory
- does not process information
- capacity: <u>large</u>, duration: <u>short</u>
- condition that has to be met for info to transfer to STM is **attention**
#### sensory registers
- sensory info is thought to be stored in seaparate sensory registers
- thought that each of the five senses has a separate register
##### iconic memory
- visual sensory memory
- stores visual images in original sensory form for 1/3 second
##### echoic memory
- auditory sensory memory
- stores sounds in original sensory form for about 3-4 seconds
- important in speech comprehension
### short term memory
- info is an encoded form of raw info (not exact)
- holds info consciously aware of
- capacity: <u>7 +/- 2 (5-9 things)</u>, duration: <u>no longer than 30 secs</u>
- if left unattended the trace fades away
### long term memory
- capacity: <u>unlimited</u>, duration: <u>unlimited</u>
- two main types of LTM:
	- **explicit** (episodic and semantic)
	- **implicit** (procedural memory and classically conditioned memory)
## serial position effect
- recall accuracy varies as a function of an item's position within a study list
- <u>primacy effect</u>: earlier items recalled more frequently than middle items
	- initial items presented are most effectively stored in LTM because of greater amount of attention/processing
- <u>recency effect</u>: things at the end of a list are recalled first
	- suggests these items are still present in working/STM
# working model of memory
- development of multi-store model of memory
![[images/Pasted image 20230530205712.png]] 
- baddely and hitch (1974) developed the working memory model ^^
- working memory consists of a central executive that coordinates two subsystems:
### central executive
- a system that allocates resources between visuospatial sketchpad and phonological loop
- the **manager** for the other two systems 
- directs attention towards tasks
### visuospatial sketchpad
- <u>limited capacity</u> (like the MSM's STM store)
- holds visual and spatial info
- visual cache = what things look like, stores info about form and colour
- inner scribe = processes spatial and movement info
### phonological loop
-  <u>limited capacity</u> 
- deals with auditory info and language (written + spoken)
- further divided into the **phonological** store (holds word heard) and the **articulatory** process (holds words heard/seen silently repeated, like an inner voice)
#### inner ear
 holds sound in a passive manner; eg someone's speech
#### inner voice
- turns visual stimuli into sounds; eg shown a list of written words, pronounce these words in mind
- allows rehearsal of info - by repeating info, increases duration of working memory + increases chance of transferring to long term memory
### episodic buffer
- (added later) component that integrates info from the other components and links to long term memory structures
- time sequencing
- eg memory of a story, event, movie scene
