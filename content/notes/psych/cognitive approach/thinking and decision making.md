title: "thinking and decision making"
---
- <u>thinking</u> is the process of using knowledge and information to make plans, interpret the world, and make predictions about the world in general
	- produces new information
- <u>decision making</u> is defined as the process of identifying and choosing alternatives based on the values and preferences of the decision maker
- common method of studying thinking and decision making is **verbal protocol interviews**, which means participants undertake a task whilst verbalising their thinking

## systems of thinking
### system 1 
- relatively **fast**
- intuitive
- emotional
- seemingly automatic
- requiring minimal cognitive effort
- influenced by bias and schemas
- uses associations and metaphors to quickly reach a simple representation of reality
- often employs <u>heuristics</u> (mental shortcuts that involve focusing on one aspect of a complex problem and ignoring others)
### system 2
- relatively **slow**
- rational/logical and therefore calculated and purposeful
- requires more cognitive effort and time
- less influenced by prejudice, bias and schemas
- uses reasoned beliefs and choices to slowly reach a less simple representation

# cognitive bias
- a systematic error in thinking that occurs when people are processing information from the world around them which then affects both thinking and decision making
**NOTE**: in IB, only have to know ==one== bias, so just focus on ==one==
### anchoring bias
- describes the common tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information we are offered (the "anchor") when making decisions
- when individuals use an initial piece of information to make subsequent judgements
### framing effect
- the way decisions are made based on the way they are presented or "framed"
- more willing to take risks to **avoid loss** and have a tendency to **avoid risk** associated with gains
### confirmation bias
-
