title: "schema theory"
---
- how we process info based on relevant previous knowledge stored in our memories and organised as schemas
- therefore predicts that what we already know will influence the outcome of information processing
- after schema has been created/activated, it influences the organisation of our knowledge -> more effective encoding
### social schemas
- stereotypes basically
- yeah..stereotypes influence how we think of others!! shocking
### scripts
- like sequential events
- filling in the gaps
### self schemas
- depression!?!?
- "negative self schema that people with depression develop about themselves, and corresponding automatic thinking patterns, are the driving force of depression" according to Aaron Beck.
## bottom-up + top-down processing
### bottom-up
- occurs when cognitive process is data-driven
- perception not biased by prior knowledge or expectations
- "pure" info processing based on the reality
### top-down
- when prior knowledge/expectations (schemas) act as a lens or filter for info that is received and processed
- leads to variety of biases, leads to stereotypes
- but is necessary; in science you need to know what to look for yk
## pattern recognition
- using schematic processing, patterns can be seen in otherwise unstructured stimuli (<u>pattern recognition</u>) and find meaning in those patterns (<u>effort after meaning</u>)
- evolution has predisposed us to see certain patterns, eg faces, sounds, language components
- <u>effort after meaning</u>: the ideas that people try to convert info from something they can't comprehend into something they can
