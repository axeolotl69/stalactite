## MAGUIRE et al 2000, London Taxi Drivers
#localisationoffunction #neuroplasticity #rmofbiologicalapproach #biologicalapproach 
**aim:** to investigate the role of the hippocampus in learning/memory in London male taxi drivers
**procedure:** 
- quasi experiment
- sample: 16 London taxi drivers (male and right-handed) and 50 non-taxi drivers (also male and right-handed)
	- taxi drivers had years of training and experience which developed their spacial recognition/awareness
- IV - taxi driver/non-taxi driver
- DV - volume of hippocampus, including their anterior, body, and posterior regions; measured by analysing MRI scans of participant's brains, analysed through pixel counting and VBM 
**findings:**
- taxi drivers had greater grey matter density in the <u>posterior hippocampus</u> compared to the control group
- positive correlation between amount of time as a taxi driver and greater volume of right posterior hippocampus (r=0.6)
- negative correlation between amount of time as a taxi driver and anterior hippocampal volume
**conclusions:**
- there are regionally specific structural differences between the hippocampi of licensed taxi drivers compared to those who are not taxi drivers
- professional dependence on navigational skills in licensed London taxi drivers is associated with a relative redistribution of grey matter in the hippocampus
- findings also indicate the possibility of local plasticity in the structure of a normal human brain which allows it to adapt in response to prolonged environmental stimuli
**strengths:**
- single blind; researcher did not know whether MRI scans belonged to taxi driver or non-taxi driver. avoids researcher bias
- ethically sound
**weaknesses:** 
- quasi experiment; only correlational findings
- sampling bias due to male population, difficult to generalise results

## HM: MILNER 1966
#rmofcognitiveapproach #localisationoffunction #multistoremodelofmemory #biologicalapproach 
**aim:** to better understand the effects that the surgery had on HM
**procedure:**
- longitudinal case study, HM had a surgery which removed tissue from medial temporal lobe (including hippocampus)
- used various different strategies, using method triangulation
	- psychometric testing; his IQ was above average
	- direct observation of his behaviour
	- interviews with HM and his family members
	- cognitive tests; memory tests and learning tasks
	- MRI to determine the extent of damage done
**findings:**
- HM could not acquire episodic or semantic knowledge; memory about events and information about world around him respectively
- he was however able to draw a picture of his house; cognitive knowledge
- had capacity for working memory; was asked to remember the number 584 and could repeat it 15 minutes after, though once the task was over HM couldn't remember it
- he knew how to mow a lawn (procedural memory)
**conclusions:**
- suggests that surgery removed brain structures which contributed to moving memories from short-term to long-term
- he could draw a photo of his house, suggesting that cognitive memory is not encoded in the same way as semantic or episodic
- suggests short-term memory is not stored in hippocampus 
- suggests that medial temporal lobe is not site of permanent storage, but organises and stores elsewhere in the brain 
**strengths:**
- longitudinal+method triangulation 
- ecological validity - less extraneous variables
- very ethically sound
**weaknesses:** 
- cannot easily be replicated
- retrospective; we did not know much about HM before the incident
- hard to generalise
## DRAGNISKI et al 2004, juggling
#neuroplasticity #neuralpruning #synapses #biologicalapproach 
**aim:** to see whether learning a new skill (juggling in this case) would have an effect on the brains of the participants
**procedure:**
- type of study: experimental
- 24 volunteers between ages 20-24; 21 females and 3 males, all non-jugglers at the start of the study
- everyone had an MRI scan at the start of the study, then the sample was separated into two groups: jugglers and non-jugglers
- jugglers were taught how to juggle, then asked to practice. when they had mastered it they would contact the researchers and have another MRI scan
- non-juggling group was the control
- three months after that, another MRI scan was taken
**findings:**
- MRIs analysed using VBM
- after they had mastered juggling, jugglers had significantly larger amounts of grey matter in the mid-temporal lobe in both hemispheres (associated with visual memory)
- the final MRI showed that this grey matter had decreased
**conclusions:**
- suggests that learning a new skill changes the grey matter density in the respective part of the brain, supporting neuroplasticity
- and that as skills are less used, neural pruning occurs.
- juggling relies more on visual memory than spatial??
**strengths:**
- 
**weaknesses:** 
- small sample size
- internal validity issues; participants were at home for most of the experiment, many extraneous variables
## CROCKETT et al 2010, trolley dilemma
#neurotransmission #agonist #biologicalapproach 
**aim:** to see whether citalopram, an SSRI, affects pro-social behaviour
**procedure:** 
- repeated measures experimental design
- sample: 30 healthy subjects, mean age was 26
- experimental group: participants given a does of citalopram (which blocks reuptake of serotonin from the synapse+boosts concentration)
- control group: was given a placebo
- research was double-blind study
- after taking the drug, participants were given a series of moral dilemmas that involved impersonal situations like the trolley problem (saving five people and killing one, or vice versa) or personal situations (pushing a man off a bridge to stop a train from killing five people)
**findings:**
- responses in the impersonal version were unaffected by citalopram
- after one dose of citalopram, participants were less likely to push the man off the bridge in the personal scenario, than participants in the placebo condition
**conclusions:**
- serotonin reduces acceptability of personal harm, and in this way promotes prosocial behaviour
- serotonin modulates reactions of the brain to emotinoally salient situations so that inflicting harm on other people is judged as less acceptable
**strengths:**
**weaknesses:** authors recognised that citalopram intake induced slight nausea, which could mean that participants could work out whether they were in the experimental on control group
## FISHER, ARON & BROWN 2005
#neurotransmission #biologicalapproach 
**aim:** to find how dopamine affects being in love (?)
**procedure:**
- sample: 10 men and 7 women who were currently "intensely in love" but not with each other, recruited by volunteering. mean age was 21 and mean duration of being in love was 7 months
- all participants went under an fMRI and engaged in a standardised procedure of looking at photos while their brains were scanned. there were four stages:
	- for 30 seconds, each participant viewed a photo of their loved one
	- 40 second filler activity which was to count back from a given number
	- 30 more seconds participants viewed a pot of an emotionally neutral acquaintance
	- final stage was 20 seconds of counting back from a given number
- these steps were repeated 6 times, so the total procedure lasted 720 seconds (12 minutes)
**findings:**
- specific pattern of activation in the brains of participants in response to the photographs of their loved ones; activation was observed in dopamine-rich neural systems, primarily the VTA and caudate nucleus
- both VTA and caudate nucleus are rich in dopamine and form the key part of the so-called copaminergic pathway - a system that generates and transmits dopamine, and increases dopamine activity in the brain
- reward system, dopaminergic activity is associated with motivation and feelings of pleasure (romantic love??)
**conclusions:**
- inferred that dopamine plays a role in love
**strengths:**
**weaknesses:** 
## SCHEELE et al 2012 (two tasks)
#hormones #oxytocin #biologicalapproach 
**aim:** to find the role of oxytocin in promoting fidelity in humans
**procedure:** 
- 86 heterosexual men, some of which were single and some were in a stable monogomous relationship
- double-blind indepdent measures design
- <u>task one:</u> subjects positions at the end of a room while an "attractive" female experimenter was positioned on the other side. subject was required to move slowly towards the female experimenter and stop at a distance that made him feel slightly uncomfortable/too close
- <u>task two:</u> subjects viewed a series of pictures on a screen 50cm away from them, each picture was shown for 2secs each. four kinds of pictures were shown: positive social, negative social, positive non-social, and negative non-social. all participants had a joystick, and if they liked the picture they were asked to pull the joystick which resulted in an increase of the pictures size/vice versa with disliked images (simulation of approach or avoidance)
- IV - oxytocin/placebo intranasally administered
- DV - how far men stood away from female researcher/how close or far the images were placed 
**findings:**
- <u>task one:</u> non-single males with oxytocin dose stood further away from women (avg of 71cm) while single males on oxytocin dose were barely affected
- <u>task two:</u> only groups of pictures affected by oxytocin and relationship status was the positive social group (attractive women pics); specifically, participants in a relationship who had oxytocin had slower reaction time in response to pictures
**conclusions:**
- oxytocin caused men in a relationship to "stay away from" an attractive woman who was not his partner
- oxytocin selectively inhibits approach to certain stimuli (attractive women) in men who are in a stable relationship, but not in single men
- oxytocin plays a role in fidelity
**strengths:**
- double blind, indepdendent measures
**weaknesses:** 


## DE DREU et al 2012
#oxytocin #biologicalapproach #hormones 
**aim:** to investigate the effect of oxytocin on inter-group conflict and out-group conflicts
**procedure:**
- double-blind experiment
- independent measures design
- sample of 102 males
- self administed a dose of oxytocin or a placebo through nasal spray
- participants were randomly assigned to 3 person groups and told they would need to compete against another group of 3
- each person was paired with a member of another 3 person group, and they played a modified version of "prisoner's dilemma" (that one game between cooperating/not cooperating and you gain/lose points)
- payoffs from the game was converted to real money and given to the participants
**findings:**
- a player's defence-motivated non-cooperation
	- is more likely if vulnerability of the player's group is high 
	- does not depend so much on the player's own vulnerability
	- is more likely in the oxytocin condition
**conclusions:**
- oxytocin-induced non-cooperation is motivated by the desire to protect vulnerable group members, and not so much the desire to protect oneself
- reinforces the role of oxytocin in creation bonds with members of your ingroup
- shows that oxytocin can have a reverse, negative side in creating defensiveness and non-cooperation with others
**strengths:**
**weaknesses:** 

## WEDEKIND et al 1995
#pheromones #biologicalapproach 
**aim:** to test whether a female will rate a sweaty t-shirt as more attractive if it is from a man with different immune system genes to her own
**procedure:**
- 49 females and 44 males tested for immune system genes
- males asked to wear a plain white t-shirt for 2 days
- t-shirts then put in closed boxes until females were asked to smell them
- females asked to rate the t-shirts for pleasantness and sexiness
**findings:**
- women rated the t-shirts as more pleasant and sexy if they came from a man with different MHC genes
**conclusions:**
- people are more motivated to find a mate with different immune system genes so their offspring will have stronger immune systems
- also concluded body odour, not pheromones, is an important element of sociosexual behaviour
**strengths:** 
- has been successfully replicated
- double blind experiment
- met ethical standards
- well controlled; ensured that it was the odor being smelt and nothing else
- ecologically valid(?)
**weaknesses:** 
- 
## ZHOU et al 2014
#pheromones #biologicalapproach 
**aim:** to see the effect of AND and EST on heterosexual and homosexual men and women
**procedure:**
- sample was four groups of healthy non-smokers, including 24 hetero males, 24 hetero females, 24 homo males and 24 bi/homo females
- participants watched stick figures walking on a screen and were asked to guess the gender of the stick figure
- while watching, participants were exposed to the smell of cloves. in experimental condition, the cloves were mixed with AND; in control only cloves were used
**findings:**
- when het females and homo men were exposed to AND they had a higher rate of identifying the stick figure as "masculine" than the control group
- AND had no significant effect on het men or homo women
**conclusions:**
- AND and EST may have some effect on human sexual behaviour
**strengths:**
- highly standardised procedure, easy to replicate
- sample allowed for differences in sexuality
- all participants were exposed to female version of AND, which was EST, and similar results were explained for het males but not as strongly for homo females
- counter-balanced to control order effects
**weaknesses:** 
- levels of AND and EST presented were much higher than the natural amount present in humans (questionable ecological validity)
