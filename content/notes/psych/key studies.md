## MAGUIRE et al 2000, London taxi drivers
#localisationoffunction #neuroplasticity #rmofbiologicalapproach #biologicalapproach #techniquestostudythebrain 
**aim:** to investigate the role of the hippocampus in learning/memory in London male taxi drivers
**procedure:** 
- quasi experiment
- sample: 16 London taxi drivers (male and right-handed) and 50 non-taxi drivers (also male and right-handed)
	- taxi drivers had years of training and experience which developed their spacial recognition/awareness
- IV - taxi driver/non-taxi driver
- DV - volume of hippocampus, including their anterior, body, and posterior regions; measured by analysing MRI scans of participant's brains, analysed through pixel counting and VBM 
**findings:**
- taxi drivers had greater grey matter density in the <u>posterior hippocampus</u> compared to the control group
- positive correlation between amount of time as a taxi driver and greater volume of right posterior hippocampus (r=0.6)
- negative correlation between amount of time as a taxi driver and anterior hippocampal volume
**conclusions:**
- there are regionally specific structural differences between the hippocampi of licensed taxi drivers compared to those who are not taxi drivers
- professional dependence on navigational skills in licensed London taxi drivers is associated with a relative redistribution of grey matter in the hippocampus
- findings also indicate the possibility of local plasticity in the structure of a normal human brain which allows it to adapt in response to prolonged environmental stimuli
**strengths:**
- single blind; researcher did not know whether MRI scans belonged to taxi driver or non-taxi driver. avoids researcher bias
- ethically sound
**weaknesses:** 
- quasi experiment; only correlational findings
- sampling bias due to male population, difficult to generalise results

## HM: MILNER 1966, bicycle boy
#rmofcognitiveapproach #localisationoffunction #multistoremodelofmemory #biologicalapproach #cognitiveapproach #techniquestostudythebrain 
**aim:** to better understand the effects that the surgery had on HM
**procedure:**
- longitudinal case study, HM had a surgery which removed tissue from medial temporal lobe (including hippocampus)
- used various different strategies, using method triangulation
	- psychometric testing; his IQ was above average
	- direct observation of his behaviour
	- interviews with HM and his family members
	- cognitive tests; memory tests and learning tasks
	- MRI to determine the extent of damage done
**findings:**
- HM could not acquire episodic or semantic knowledge; memory about events and information about world around him respectively
- he was however able to draw a picture of his house; cognitive knowledge
- had capacity for working memory; was asked to remember the number 584 and could repeat it 15 minutes after, though once the task was over HM couldn't remember it
- he knew how to mow a lawn (procedural memory)
**conclusions:**
- suggests that surgery removed brain structures which contributed to moving memories from short-term to long-term
- he could draw a photo of his house, suggesting that cognitive memory is not encoded in the same way as semantic or episodic
- suggests short-term memory is not stored in hippocampus 
- suggests that medial temporal lobe is not site of permanent storage, but organises and stores elsewhere in the brain 
**strengths:**
- longitudinal+method triangulation 
- ecological validity - less extraneous variables
- very ethically sound
**weaknesses:** 
- cannot easily be replicated
- retrospective; we did not know much about HM before the incident
- hard to generalise
## DRAGNISKI et al 2004, juggling
#neuroplasticity #neuralpruning #synapses #biologicalapproach #techniquestostudythebrain 
**aim:** to see whether learning a new skill (juggling in this case) would have an effect on the brains of the participants
**procedure:**
- type of study: experimental
- 24 volunteers between ages 20-24; 21 females and 3 males, all non-jugglers at the start of the study
- everyone had an MRI scan at the start of the study, then the sample was separated into two groups: jugglers and non-jugglers
- jugglers were taught how to juggle, then asked to practice. when they had mastered it they would contact the researchers and have another MRI scan
- non-juggling group was the control
- three months after that, another MRI scan was taken
**findings:**
- MRIs analysed using VBM
- after they had mastered juggling, jugglers had significantly larger amounts of grey matter in the mid-temporal lobe in both hemispheres (associated with visual memory)
- the final MRI showed that this grey matter had decreased
**conclusions:**
- suggests that learning a new skill changes the grey matter density in the respective part of the brain, supporting neuroplasticity
- and that as skills are less used, neural pruning occurs.
- juggling relies more on visual memory than spatial??
**strengths:**
- 
**weaknesses:** 
- small sample size
- internal validity issues; participants were at home for most of the experiment, many extraneous variables
 ## CROCKETT et al 2010, trolley dilemma
#neurotransmission #agonist #biologicalapproach 
**aim:** to see whether citalopram, an SSRI, affects pro-social behaviour
**procedure:** 
- repeated measures experimental design
- sample: 30 healthy subjects, mean age was 26
- experimental group: participants given a does of citalopram (which blocks reuptake of serotonin from the synapse+boosts concentration)
- control group: was given a placebo
- research was double-blind study
- after taking the drug, participants were given a series of moral dilemmas that involved impersonal situations like the trolley problem (saving five people and killing one, or vice versa) or personal situations (pushing a man off a bridge to stop a train from killing five people)
**findings:**
- responses in the impersonal version were unaffected by citalopram
- after one dose of citalopram, participants were less likely to push the man off the bridge in the personal scenario, than participants in the placebo condition
**conclusions:**
- serotonin reduces acceptability of personal harm, and in this way promotes prosocial behaviour
- serotonin modulates reactions of the brain to emotinoally salient situations so that inflicting harm on other people is judged as less acceptable
**strengths:**
**weaknesses:** authors recognised that citalopram intake induced slight nausea, which could mean that participants could work out whether they were in the experimental on control group
## FISHER, ARON & BROWN 2005, dopamine and Love
#neurotransmission #biologicalapproach #techniquestostudythebrain 
**aim:** to find how dopamine affects being in love (?)
**procedure:**
- sample: 10 men and 7 women who were currently "intensely in love" but not with each other, recruited by volunteering. mean age was 21 and mean duration of being in love was 7 months
- all participants went under an fMRI and engaged in a standardised procedure of looking at photos while their brains were scanned. there were four stages:
	- for 30 seconds, each participant viewed a photo of their loved one
	- 40 second filler activity which was to count back from a given number
	- 30 more seconds participants viewed a pot of an emotionally neutral acquaintance
	- final stage was 20 seconds of counting back from a given number
- these steps were repeated 6 times, so the total procedure lasted 720 seconds (12 minutes)
**findings:**
- specific pattern of activation in the brains of participants in response to the photographs of their loved ones; activation was observed in dopamine-rich neural systems, primarily the VTA and caudate nucleus
- both VTA and caudate nucleus are rich in dopamine and form the key part of the so-called copaminergic pathway - a system that generates and transmits dopamine, and increases dopamine activity in the brain
- reward system, dopaminergic activity is associated with motivation and feelings of pleasure (romantic love??)
**conclusions:**
- inferred that dopamine plays a role in love
**strengths:**
**weaknesses:** 
## SCHEELE et al 2012, Women
#hormones #oxytocin #biologicalapproach 
**aim:** to find the role of oxytocin in promoting fidelity in humans
**procedure:** 
- 86 heterosexual men, some of which were single and some were in a stable monogomous relationship
- double-blind independent measures design
- <u>task one:</u> subjects positions at the end of a room while an "attractive" female experimenter was positioned on the other side. subject was required to move slowly towards the female experimenter and stop at a distance that made him feel slightly uncomfortable/too close
- <u>task two:</u> subjects viewed a series of pictures on a screen 50cm away from them, each picture was shown for 2secs each. four kinds of pictures were shown: positive social, negative social, positive non-social, and negative non-social. all participants had a joystick, and if they liked the picture they were asked to pull the joystick which resulted in an increase of the pictures size/vice versa with disliked images (simulation of approach or avoidance)
- IV - oxytocin/placebo intranasally administered
- DV - how far men stood away from female researcher/how close or far the images were placed 
**findings:**
- <u>task one:</u> non-single males with oxytocin dose stood further away from women (avg of 71cm) while single males on oxytocin dose were barely affected
- <u>task two:</u> only groups of pictures affected by oxytocin and relationship status was the positive social group (attractive women pics); specifically, participants in a relationship who had oxytocin had slower reaction time in response to pictures
**conclusions:**
- oxytocin caused men in a relationship to "stay away from" an attractive woman who was not his partner
- oxytocin selectively inhibits approach to certain stimuli (attractive women) in men who are in a stable relationship, but not in single men
- oxytocin plays a role in fidelity
**strengths:**
- double blind, indepdendent measures
**weaknesses:** 
- sample bad why hetero men only
## DE DREU et al 2012, prisoner's dilemma
#oxytocin #biologicalapproach #hormones 
**aim:** to investigate the effect of oxytocin on inter-group conflict and out-group conflicts
**procedure:**
- double-blind experiment
- independent measures design
- sample of 102 males
- self administed a dose of oxytocin or a placebo through nasal spray
- participants were randomly assigned to 3 person groups and told they would need to compete against another group of 3
- each person was paired with a member of another 3 person group, and they played a modified version of "prisoner's dilemma" (that one game between cooperating/not cooperating and you gain/lose points)
- payoffs from the game was converted to real money and given to the participants
**findings:**
- a player's defence-motivated non-cooperation
	- is more likely if vulnerability of the player's group is high 
	- does not depend so much on the player's own vulnerability
	- is more likely in the oxytocin condition
**conclusions:**
- oxytocin-induced non-cooperation is motivated by the desire to protect vulnerable group members, and not so much the desire to protect oneself
- reinforces the role of oxytocin in creation bonds with members of your ingroup
- shows that oxytocin can have a reverse, negative side in creating defensiveness and non-cooperation with others
**strengths:**
**weaknesses:** 

## WEDEKIND et al 1995, sweaty t-shirts
#pheromones #biologicalapproach #evolution 
**aim:** to test whether a female will rate a sweaty t-shirt as more attractive if it is from a man with different immune system genes to her own
**procedure:**
- 49 females and 44 males tested for immune system genes (MHC)
- males asked to wear a plain white t-shirt for 2 days
- t-shirts then put in closed boxes until females were asked to smell them
- females asked to rate the t-shirts for pleasantness and sexiness
**findings:**
- women rated the t-shirts as more pleasant and sexy if they came from a man with different MHC genes
**conclusions:**
- people are more motivated to find a mate with different immune system genes so their offspring will have stronger immune systems
- also concluded body odour, not pheromones, is an important element of sociosexual behaviour
**strengths:** 
- has been successfully replicated
- double blind experiment
- met ethical standards
- well controlled; ensured that it was the odor being smelt and nothing else
- ecologically valid(?)
**weaknesses:** 
- 
## ZHOU et al 2014, stick figure
#pheromones #biologicalapproach 
**aim:** to see the effect of AND and EST on heterosexual and homosexual men and women
**procedure:**
- sample was four groups of healthy non-smokers, including 24 hetero males, 24 hetero females, 24 homo males and 24 bi/homo females
- participants watched stick figures walking on a screen and were asked to guess the gender of the stick figure
- while watching, participants were exposed to the smell of cloves. in experimental condition, the cloves were mixed with AND; in control only cloves were used
**findings:**
- when het females and homo men were exposed to AND they had a higher rate of identifying the stick figure as "masculine" than the control group
- AND had no significant effect on het men or homo women
**conclusions:**
- AND and EST may have some effect on human sexual behaviour
**strengths:**
- highly standardised procedure, easy to replicate
- sample allowed for differences in sexuality
- all participants were exposed to female version of AND, which was EST, and similar results were explained for het males but not as strongly for homo females
- counter-balanced to control order effects
**weaknesses:** 
- levels of AND and EST presented were much higher than the natural amount present in humans (questionable ecological validity)

## CASPI et al 2003, 5-HTT
#depression #biologicalapproach #genetics 
**aim:** to determine whether there is evidence for a gene-environment interaction for a mutation of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTT).
**procedure:**
- natural experiment (IV is natually occuring), longitudinal study
- sample: 847 New Zealand 26 year olds, who had been assessed for mental health every other year until they were 21
- divided into 3 groups based on their 5-HTT alleles:
	- group 1: 2 short alleles, homozygous (recessive)
	- group 2: 1 long + 1 short allele, heterozygous
	- group 3: 2 long alleles, homozygous
- mutation of the 5-HTT gene has shorter allele
- participants asked to fill in a "stressful life events" questionare, asking them about the frequency of 14 different events including financial, employment, health and relationship stressors between the ages of 21-26
- they were assessed for depression too (method triangulation)
**findings:**
- people who had inherited one or more of the short alleles (group 1 and 2) demonstrated more symptoms of depression in response to stressful life events
- the effect was strongest for those with 3 or more stressful life events (environment factor)
- inheriting the gene alone was <u>not</u> enough to lead to depression, but the genes' interaction with these events increased one's likelihood of developing depression
**conclusions:**
**strengths:**
**weaknesses:** 
## WEISSMAN et al 2005, MDD kinship
#majordepressivedisorder #biologicalapproach #genetics #kinshipstudy #geneticsimilarity
**aim:** to investigate the potential genetic nature of Major Depressive Disorder
**procedure:**
- longitudinal kinship study taking place over 20 years
- original sample was depressed grandparents, and the control group were selected from local community
- data collected from clinicians, blind to past diagnosis of depression and data from previous interviews
**findings:**
- 59.2% of grandchildren with family history of MDD were showing signs of a psychiatric disorder by 12 years old
- children had increased risk of any disorder if depression was observed in both the grandparents and parents, compared to children whose parents did not have depression
- the severity of a parent's depression was correlated with an increased rate of mood disorder in the children
- if a parent was depressed, but there was no history of depression in the grandparents, there was no significant effect of parental depression on the grandchildren
**conclusions:**
**strengths:**
- researcher triangulation used
- children were evaluated by both a child psychiatrist and another psychologist
- single-blind (researchers unaware of MDD history)
**weaknesses:** 
- no actual genotype was studied
- correlational
- small sample size
## KENDLER et al 2006 MDD twins
#genetics #twinstudy #biologicalapproach #majordepressivedisorder 
**aim:** three aims...
1.  Past studies suggest a 35-45% heritability of major depression. Would this be true in a large Swedish sample? 
2.  Are there significant gender differences in the heritability of major depression? 
3.  Is there evidence that genetic and environmental factors in major depression differ over time?
**procedure:**
- sample: 15,493 complete twin pairs listed in the Swedish Twin Registry, only twins whose zygosity could be verified were used in the study.
- Researchers used a team of trained interviewers to carry out telephone interviews between 1998 and 2003. The interviewers assessed lifetime major depression using modified DSM-IV criteria 
- 8056 twins met the criteria for diagnosis of MDD at some point in their life
- interviewers also asked questions about the twins “shared environment” and their “individual specific environment"
**findings:**
**![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/KZVzXuglvIxmQVLeGR7eJ73yIPycX1u0Gv_jIVcze5q9Aonv0eskPCGzr2iUK1IG775kUzfqLyd26s5c--LCK9XBBwNg9IHSSavm_Y1QUmYrwVVxcMf6M3RZ4dcSgiC6ntDdqhWiss8iYiRljpJmCfaD2A=s2048)
- concordance rates for MDD were significantly higher in women than men
- significantly higher in MZ twins than DZ twins
- no correlation between number of years twins had lived together and MDD
- estimated heritability of MDD was 0.348, in line with previous research
- no significant differences in role of genetic and environmental factors in MDD
**conclusions:**
- suggests heritability of MDD is higher in women than men, and that some genetic risk factors are sex-specific
**strengths:**
- confirms previous research, strengthening the reliability of the findings
**weaknesses:** 
- correlational
- large sample size
- self-reported
## BUSS 1989, mate selection
#biologicalapproach #evolution 
**aim:** to test three evolution-based assumptions about human mate selection: 
1. as men are searching for women with high reproductive value, they will favour youth and physical appearance
2. as woman are searching for men who will invest in their offspring, they will favour a man with the resources he can provide
3. as men do not want to invest in another man's child, abstinence will be highly valued
**procedure:**
- 37 samples taken from 33 countries, total of 10k participants
- each sample completed two surveys; the first collected biographical data asking participants what age they prefer to marry at, their preferred age difference between themselves and their spouse, who should be older in a couple and how many children they want
- they then rated 18 characteristics on a 4-point scale on how important they think they are
- second survey provided 13 characteristics that participants were asked to rank in terms of desirability in a mate
**findings:**
- in 36/37 samples, women valued "good financial prospects" in a potential mate more than males did
- in all samples, men preferred mates who are younger, with an average age of 24.83 (close to the peak female fertility age)
- 34/37 samples showed that males value physical attractiveness in potential mates more than females do
- only 23/37 samples valued chastity
**conclusions:**
- proved the first two points correct, but not the third
**strengths:**
**weaknesses:** 
- low temporal (time) validity; done many decades ago and social norms have changes
- uses etic approach - meaning that it is rooted in the culture of the researcher, other cultures might not put such significance on these specific aspects
## ROGERS AND KESNER 2003, rats in maze
#animalmodels #neurotransmission #rmofbiologicalapproach #antagonist 
**aim:** to determine the role of acetylcholine in the formation of spatial memory
**procedure:**
- had 30 rats acclimate to a maze by placing food in one of the corners
- once the rats were familiar with the maze (and weren't afraid of it) they begun the experiment
- rats were randomly allocated to one of two conditions; either injected with scopolamine (blocks acetylcholine receptor sites and inhibits response, antagonist) or saline solution (placebo) ten minutes before running the maze, with the injection made directly into the hippocampus
- encoding memory was assessed by the average number of errors made on the first five trials of day 1 compared to the last five trials of day 1, whereas retrieval of memory was assessed by the average number of errors made on the first five trials of day 2 compared to the last five trials of day 1
**findings:**
- scopolamine group took longer and made more mistakes (had higher average number of mistakes on last five trials of day 1)
- but, it did not have a significant effect on retrieval of memories 
**conclusions:**
- acetylcholine may play an important role in the consolidation of spatial memory
**strengths:**
- used a placebo to avoid confounding variables
- is able to establish cause and effect relationship
**weaknesses:** 
- questionable whether it can be generalised to humans 
## ROMERO et al 2014, dogs
#hormones #animalmodels #oxytocin 
**aim:** to investigate the role of oxytocin in social bonds between mammals in non-reproductive contexts
**procedure:**
- 16 dogs were sprayed intra-nasally with either oxytocin or a placebo (repeated measures, double-blind counterbalanced design)
- placed with their owner and another dog in the same room, and their behaviour was recorded by 4 cameras in 1 hour
- room was empty except for a chair where dog owner sat; owner was instructed to move the chair in pre-designated positions in every 10 minutes, but otherwise sit quietly and not interact with the dogs
**findings:**
- dogs sprayed with oxytocin showed higher affiliation towards owners
- affiliation was operationalised as sniffing, licking, gentle touching with nose or paw, play bouts and body contact
- dogs spent more time in close proximity to their owner
- similar results observed for the dog partner (the other dog in the room)
**conclusions:**
- performs the function of maintaining close social bonds in mammals
**strengths:**
**weaknesses:** 
## MERZENICH 1984 monkey finger
#neuroplasticity #animalmodels #corticalremapping
**aim:** studied the cortical representation of the hand in eight adult owl monkeys
**procedure:**
- eight adult owl monkeys
- sensory inputs from all the fingers were mapped in the cortex (electrodes inserted into cortical area known to be responsible for sensation from the hand, then researchers stimulated various areas on the fingers one by one and noted which electrode was responding. monkeys were anesthetised beforehand)
- the middle finger on the monkey's hand was amputated
- 62 days later a remapping was done to see how the cortical area responsible for sensitivity from the hand changed after amputation
**findings:**
- results of the first mapping showed that there were five distinct areas in the brain, each responsible for one finger, with adjacent fingers represented in adjacent areas in the cortex
- after the finger was amputated, adjacent areas (responsible for sensitivity from digits 2 and 4) spread and occupied parts of the now unused (3) area
- areas for 2 and 4 became larger while 1 and 5 stayed the same 
**conclusions:**
- cortical remapping of sensory inputs from the hand occurs within 62 days in owl monkeys
**strengths:**
**weaknesses:** 
## GLANZER AND CUNITZ 1966, words msmm
#multistoremodelofmemory #cognitiveapproach #modelsofmemory 
**aim:** to investigate whether the interval of time between words on a list would increase number of words recalled at the start of the list. (eg primacy vs recency)
**procedure:**
- sample: 240 army enlisted men
- independent samples design
- 40 men allocated to each condition:
	- words read once at 3sec rate
	- words read twice at 3sec rate
	- words read once at 6sec rate
	- words read twice at 6sec rate
	- words read once at 9sec rate
	- words read twice at 9sec rate
- participants first given two 5-word practice lists so they could learn the procedure
- listened to recordings of eight 20-word lists, lists were the same for each group
- all words common one-syllable words
- participants had two minutes to write down the words they recalled in any order
**findings:**
- increased time interval between words led to an increase in the recall of all words in the list except for those at the end
- effect of repetition on recall was limited to 3sec rate
- no significant effect on recall in the 6 or 9sec rates
**conclusions:**
- primacy is the result of rehearsal
- increased time interval allowed for more rehearsal, thus greater overall recall of the list of words
- however, words in the STM were still available in working memory, no significant change in frequency of recall
- words at end of the list are not rehearsed as often and thus decay from STM
- supports idea that LTM and STM are separate stores
**strengths:**
- standardised procedure
- independent samples
**weaknesses:** 
- low ecological validity 

## LANDRY AND BARTLING 2011, letters wmm
#cognitiveapproach #workingmemorymodel #rmofcognitiveapproach #modelsofmemory 
**aim:** to investigate if articulatory suppression would influence the recall of a written list of phonologically dissimilar letters in serial recall.
**procedure:**
- sample: 34 undergrad psych students, individually tested
- independent samples design
- experimental group: participants saw a list of letters that they had to recall while saying the numbers 1 and 2 at a rate of two numbers per second (articulatory suppression task - so they couldn't say things out loud)
- control group: saw letters but did not have to carry out articulatory suppression task
- the letters shown were chosen because they do not sound similar
- trials were repeated ten times
- trials were scored as correct if the letters were in the correct position
**findings:**
- experimental group had much lower scores than control
- mean percentage of accurate recall in control was 76% compared to 45% in experimental
- standard deviation for both were nearly identical: 0.13 and 0.14
**conclusions:**
- articulatory suppression prevents rehearsal in the phonological loop because of Overload - thus, difficulty in memorising letter strings
**strengths:**
- easily replicable
**weaknesses:** 
- lacks ecological validity
## BRANSFORD AND JOHNSON 1972, topic schema
#cognitiveapproach #schematheory #effortaftermeaning #modelsofmemory
**aim:** to determine whether schema activation would result in a better understanding and recall of an ambiguous text.
**procedure:**
- sample: 52 participants
- allocated to one of three conditions: **no topic** group (heard passage w no additional info), **topic after** group (told the topic of passage after hearing it), **topic before** group (told topic of passage before hearing it)
- all participants listened to tape-recorded passage and were told that they would later be asked to recall the passage as accurately as possible
- all tested at the same time, but had different booklets
- given five minutes for recall
- all also asked to rate comprehension on scale of 1-7
**findings:**
- no significant difference between no topic and topic after, but significantly higher number of "ideas" recalled for topic before group, and significantly higher comprehension too
**conclusions:**
- prior knowledge of a situation does not guarantee its usefulness for comprehension; for prior knowledge to aid comprehension, it must become an activated semantic context
**strengths:**
- independent samples
- highly controlled
**weaknesses:** 
- ecological validity, kinda artificial
## ANDERSON AND PICHERT 1978, burglar homeowner
#cognitiveapproach #modelsofmemory #schematheory 
**aim:** investigated the role of schema in the encoding and recall of a story
**procedure:**
- sample: 39 participants...all psych students...
- the story had 72 discreet ideas: 15 related to a burglary, 13 related to purchasing a home
- participants randomly allocated to "robber" or "home buyer" condition
- given two minutes to **read** the story as their role, then given 12 minutes to take an 84-item vocab test (filler task)
- then asked to write down as much of the story as they could
- given five minutes for another filler
- then asked to recall a second time: half were told to do from the same perspective they used in the first recall, half told to use the opposing perspective
**findings:**
- burglr info was recalled better than homebuyer info LOL may be because students do not have a well-developed homebuyer schema
- group that had burglar perspective recalled more burglar info and homebuyers recalled more homebuyer info
**conclusions:**
- schema influenced encoding
- schema influenced retrieval
**strengths:**
- highly controlled
**weaknesses:** 
- artificial (ecological validity)
- tiny sample
- order effects? fatigue effects
## LOFTUS AND PALMER 1974, cars
#cognitiveapproach #rmofcognitiveapproach #reconstructivememory
**aim:** to investigate the role of leading questions in influencing the estimation of speed
**procedure:**
- sample: 45 students, divided into five groups
- 7 films of traffic accidents were shown with the length of the films ranging from 5-30secs
- independent samples; each participant watched all 7 films
- asked to give an account of the accident they had seen and answered a questionnaire with various questions: the critical question asking them to estimate the speed of the cards involved in the accident
- all asked the same question but included different words for different groups: "about how fast were the cars going when they ... each other", replaced with hit, collided, bumped, smashed, contacted
**findings:**
- mean estimates of speed highest in "smashed" condition (40.8mph)
- lowest in "contacted" (31.8mph)
**conclusions:**
- two conclusions:
	- response bias: participants uncertain about exact speed, and thus verbs like "smashed" biases their response to be higher
	- the wording of the question changed the mental representation of the accident; thus "smashed" activates cognitive schema of sever accident
- participant's memory of an accident could be changed by using suggestive questions
**strengths:**
- confounding variables controlled
**weaknesses:**
- low ecological validity
- students as sample = biased
- students may not have driving experience, thus not representative of general population
## YUILLE AND CUTSHALL 1986, crime
#reconstructivememory #rmofcognitiveapproach #cognitiveapproach 
**aim:** to determine whether leading questions would affect the memory of eyewitnesses at a real crime scene. 
**procedure:**
- crime scene; thief entered a gun shop and stole money and guns from shop. owner freed himself, went outside the shop, but the thief shot him. thief died after police arrived
- 13 eyewitnesses agreed to be interviewed as part of a study
- gave their account of the incident four months after the event, and were asked questions
- two leading questions were used; half the group asked if they saw "a" broken headlight on the getaway car, half asked if they saw "the" broken headlight
- there was no broken headlight
- second question: "the" yellow panel vs "a" yellow panel 
- panel was actually blue
- asked to rate their stress on the day of the event on a seven-point scale
**findings:**
- eyewitnesses very reliable
- recalled a large amount of accurate detail confirmed by police reports
- 10/13 said there was no broken headlight or yellow quarter panel/hadn't noticed these things
**conclusions:**
- contradicts loftus and palmer
- could be that the lack of emotional response in l&p played a key role in influence of leading question
**strengths:**
- naturalistic (?)
- archival evidence to confirm accuracy of memories
**weaknesses:** 
- not replicable
- not generalisable
## SHAROT ET AL 2007, 9/11
#cognitiveapproach #flashbulbmemory #localisationoffunction #techniquestostudythebrain 
**aim:** to determine the potential role of biological factors on flashbulb memories.
**procedure:** 
- sample: 24 participants, all were in nyc on the day of 9/11
- recruited through advertisements
- put into an fMRI
- while in the scanner, presented with words on a screen - "summer" and "september" were included in order to have participants link the words to the events of 9/11 
- brain activity observed as they recalled the event
- participants then asked to rate their memories for vividness, detail, confidence in accuracy, and arousal
- also asked to write a description of the memories
**findings:**
- half of the participants reported having a "flashbulb memory", and those who did reported that they were closer to the world trade centre - they also provided more specific details
- activation of amygdala for those closer to the event was higher recalling the events of 9/11 than the event of the preceding summer, whereas those further away from the event had similar activation of the amygdala between the two events
**conclusions:**
- close personal experience may be critical in the process of creating flashbulb memories
**strengths:**
- no demand characteristics!
**weaknesses:** 
- highly artificial thus low ecological validity
- small sample size, culturally biased
- correlational
## NEISSER AND HARSCH 1992, the challenger
#rmofcognitiveapproach #cognitiveapproach #flashbulbmemory 
**aim:** to determine whether flashbulb memories are susceptible to distortion.
**procedure:**
- sample: 106 -> 44 university psychology students
- taking place the morning after the Challenger disaster, they were given a questionnaire on the events, asking questions such as "where were you" and "how did you hear about it"
- 2 and 1/2 years later, they were given the same questionnaire, and then also asked about how accurate they thought their memory was (1-5)
- then a few months later, an interview was held 
**findings:**
- after comparing the initial responses to the questionnaire to the one completed 2 1/2 years later, it was found that out of the 7 "content" questions, there was a large discrepancy amongst most participants - only 3 had their questionnaires completely match up
**conclusions:**
- suggests that flashbulb memories aren't as reliable as they can still be manipulated after
**strengths:**
- method triangulation - both questionnaires and interviews used
- high ecological validity
**weaknesses:** 
- cannot be replicated
- possible demand characteristics
## GRIGGS AND COX 1982, Wason selection
#cognitiveapproach #thinkingsystems #dualprocessingmodel 
**aim:** to see if matching bias was less commonly used to solve the Wason Selection task when the task was more personally relevant
**procedure:**
- sample: 144 undergrad psych students, randomly allocated to 6 groups
- three tasks were completed (in varying order)
- abstract task: letters and numbers
- intermediate: colour of shirt and age
- memory cueing: drink and age
**findings:**
- abstract task: 3% solved correctly
- intermediate: 43% solved correctly
- memory cueing: 60% solved correctly
- when task cued memory of past experience, rational approach was used
- more abstract and less relevant, more likely cognitive biases were used
**conclusions:**
- matching bias less commonly used when task was more personally relevant
- when task is not abstract, 75% are able to correctly solve the problem, showing that system1 works well
**strengths:**
- has been replicated with similar results
- repeated measures + counterbalancing
**weaknesses:** 
- highly artificial, thus low ecological validity
- sampling bias (psych students)
## ENGLICH AND MUSSWEILER 2001, judges
#biasesinthinkinganddecisionmaking #cognitivebiases #cognitiveapproach #dualprocessingmodel #anchoringbias
**aim:** to determine the effect of a prosecutor's suggestion for sentencing on the decision-making of a judge.
**procedure:**
- sample: 19 young trial judges (independent samples), little experience
- given a case of alleged rape, participants were given case materials and asked to read through and form an opinion. after, they were given a questionnaire - half were told the prosecutor demanded 34 months sentences and other half were told 2 month sentence
- then asked questions about their recommended sentence, how certain they were, and how realistic they thought the case was
**findings:**
- judges reported low certainty levels
- 2 months: avg sentence was 18ish months
- 34 months: 28ish months
**conclusions:**
- anchoring bias is present
- given a lower demand for months sentenced, judges were more inclined to give a lower sentence etc
**strengths:**
- advice was sought from highly experienced trial judges
- case material tested on senior law students (pilot group) - avg was 17ish months
**weaknesses:** 
- independent samples = participant variability = confounding variables
- small sample size
## TVERSKY AND KAHNEMANN 1974, multiplication
#biasesinthinkinganddecisionmaking #cognitivebiases #cognitiveapproach #anchoringbias 
**aim:** to investigate the effects of anchoring bias on the estimation of an equation
**procedure:**
- sample: high school students
- half were shown the equation 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 x 7 x 8
- other half were shown 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 
- asked to quickly estimate the value
**findings:**
- those who were shown the "ascending" equation estimated a lower mean (512) than those who were shown the "descending" equation (2250)
**conclusions:**
- since equations are read left to right, the first number is used as an anchor and thus those who had "1" would estimate lower than "8"
**strengths:**
- easily replicated
**weaknesses:** 
- low ecological validity
## SPARROW 2011, google effect
#cognitiveapproach #digitaltechnologyandcognitiveprocessing 
#googleeffect
**aim:** to investigate the effects of technology on cognition
**procedure:**
- sample: sixty undergraduate students at Harvard
- asked to type 40 facts into a computer, some were well known and some were more surprising
- 2x2 independent samples design; half were told the data could be saved into the computer, half were told that it would be erased. half were told to remember the information, half were not (four separate conditions in total)
- asked to recall as many facts as they could in 10 minutes
- then given a recognition task to see if they could recall which facts were shown
**findings:**
- asking to remember the information made no significant difference on how well they remembered
- but there was a significant difference in recollection on those who were told the information would be saved vs those who were told the information would be erased
- those who were told the information would be saved did not remember as many facts as the others
**conclusions:**
- google effect is real; if one knows that information is stored elsewhere they will make less effort to store and remember the information
**strengths:**
- ????
**weaknesses:** 
- replications of this study have provided results that contradict sparrow's, thus the validity of this study can be questioned
- low ecological validity - these facts are trivia, and may not be important to participants
## ASCH 1956, conformity Lines
#conformity #socioculturalapproach #socialidentitytheory
**aim:** to investigate the influence of normative social influence on one's likelihood to conform in an unambiguous task
**procedure:**
- 123 male students in the USA, told that they were undertaking a vision test (deception)
- IV: unanimous incorrect response
- DV: level of conformity (agreeing with incorrect response)
- naive participant + six participants
- presented a line, and asked to say out loud the line number they thought matches the length of the original line
- confederates asked to sometimes say the incorrect answer
- interviews carried out after the experiment
**findings:**
- 75% participants conformed at least once
- during interviews, multiple reasons for conforming were given:
	- thought that they were wrong
	- unsure of their answer
	- didn't want to be ridiculed by the group
**conclusions:**
- even though many participants thought they were right, they changed their behaviour to match everyone else's. suggests that people conform and comply with majority
**strengths:**
- used a control group, where only the participant was present with no confederates
- easily replicable
**weaknesses:** 
- low ecological validity
- biased sample
## DRURY ET AL 2009, vr manchester trains 
#socialidentitytheory #socioculturalapproach 
**aim:** to investigate the role of social identity theory in pro-social behaviour.
**procedure:** 
- sample; 40 students, age 20-25
- independent samples
- used vr simulator to simulate the london metro, needing to escape a fire
- they could push people out of the way or help people
- participants were primed by either being given a scenario about watching a football game and going home with other fans (in-group) or going shopping alone and going home (no in-group)
**findings:**
- those with the in-group identification were more likely to help others than those who did not have in-group identification
**conclusions:**
- altruistic behaviour is more likely to be shown when one has a strong in-group identification towards those within the same group
**strengths:**
- replicable, showing reliability of results
- ethical, does not cause undue stress or harm etc
**weaknesses:** 
- ecological validity; using vr may not be realistic and participants did not feel like they were in danger
## BANDURA 1961, bobo dolls
#socioculturalapproach #socialcognitivetheory 
**aim:** to investigate whether children could learn aggressive behaviours by watching the behaviour of adults
**procedure:**
- 72 young boys and girls, using matched pairs of aggressiveness levels
- put into a room with toys and a bobo (inflatable) doll
- control group: no model, group exposed to aggressive model, group exposed to passive model
- another variable was whether the model was the same sex as the participants or not
- stage one: in non-aggressive condition, model quietly played with blocks, in aggressive condition, model was aggressive towards the doll
- stage two: mild aggression arousal; children were told they couldn't play with the toys
- stage three: brought to a room with the choice of non-aggressive and aggressive toys, children were observed through a one-way mirror
**findings:**
- aggressive condition made more aggressive acts than non-aggressive condition
- boys made more aggressive acts than girls, and boys with a male model made more aggressive acts than boys with a female model
**conclusions:**
- children can learn aggressive behaviours, especially when the model is more similar to them (same sex)
**strengths:**
- matched pairs, controlling more variables
- also provides evidence for the motivation factor of SCT
**weaknesses:** 
- ethical concerns, undue stress or harm, consent
- small sample size
- lacks ecological validity
## JOY, KIMBALL & ZABRACK 1986, video games and violence
#socialcognitivetheory #socioculturalapproach 
**aim:** to investigate the impact of television on children's aggressive behaviour by carrying out a longitudinal natural experiment
**procedure:**
- conducted in three small towns in Canada, where television was recently introduced
- psychologists observed both physical and verbally aggressive behaviour displayed by elementary school children on the playground a year before a television channel was accessible, and then two years after the channel was accessible
- 120 children in the sample
- teacher and peer ratings of aggressive behaviour and information about television viewing habits were obtained
**findings:**
- aggressive behaviour in this town increased significantly after the introduction of the television channel
**conclusions:**
- television had an impact on the level of aggression shown by children, due to heightened arousal obtained when watching television
**strengths:**
- 
- data triangulation
**weaknesses:** 
- internal validity was low - many uncontrolled variables
- may not be reliable, difficult to generalise
## ROSENTHAL AND JACOBSON 1968, teachers and bloomers
#stereotypes #socioculturalapproach 
**aim:** to determine whether or not teachers' expectations of students' performance affected the students' learning throughout the course of the year
**procedure:**
- out of a class of elementary school students, teachers were told that a certain amount were likely to be "academic bloomers" in the coming year based on the results of an academic test
- in reality, there wasn't a test and the students were chosen randomly
- researchers observed the classroom dynamics throughout the year
- at the end of the year the students all took an IQ test
**findings:**
- students chosen as "bloomers" demonstrated an increase in IQ, gaining higher scores than their peers
**conclusions:**
- teachers' perceptions of the students' ability affected the way the teachers interacted with the students, making the predictions of the students' ability come true (self-fulfilling prophecy)
**strengths:**
- high ecological validity - held in a real classroom environment with real students and teachers
- single blind experiment - participants not aware
**weaknesses:** 
- confounding variables that were not controlled
- lack of consent and also deception and also undue stress or harm and also right to withdraw and also
## STEELE AND ARONSON 1995
#stereotypes #socioculturalapproach 
**aim:** to investigate the effect of stereotype threat on performance (stereotype threat: the idea that stereotypes can affect the behaviour of an individual even if they do not believe in the stereotype)
**procedure:**
- was given a 30 minute verbal test made up of difficult multiple choice questions
- one group was told it was a genuine test of verbal ability 
- in another group, where they were not told it was a test of their ability
- in another version of the experiment, some participants were required to fill in a questionnaire where it asked to identify their race
**findings:**
- one group was told it was a genuine test of verbal ability - african american participants scored significantly lower than european american participants
- in another group, where they were not told it was a test of their ability, african american students scored higher than african american students in the first group, and also were not significantly different from their european american counterparts
- when asked to identify their race, african americans did poorly compared to african americans who did not have to identify their race
**conclusions:**
- stereotypes surrounding the verbal ability of african americans negatively affected their scores on the test
- whether or not the participants believed in the stereotypes, the amount of anxiety may increase and performance will therefore decrease 
**strengths:**
- standardized test/instructions
**weaknesses:** 
- low ecological validity (lacks realism)
- not a representative sample (only uni students)
## BERRY 1967, c vs i and conformity
#socioculturalapproach #conformity #culturaldimensions 
**aim:** to investigate the level of conformity in collectivist and individualist cultures.
**procedure:**
- sample:
	- temne people of sierra leone (collectivist)
	- inuit people of canada (individualist)
	- scots (control)
- used <u>asch's paradigm</u>, where participants were asked to choose a line that matched the length of the top line
- on the third test, they were told beforehand that someone from their culture had chosen a line - this line was the correct one
- however, for the next three tests, they were told that someone from their culture had chosen a line that was obviously the wrong answer
**findings:**
- temne had higher rate of conformity, where they were more likely to choose the line that they thought other temne people had chosen even if it was obviously wrong
- scots had lower rates of conformity than temne
- inuits had lower rates of conformity than scots
**conclusions:**
- those from a collectivist culture are more likely to conform than those in an individualist culture
- this aligns with hofstede's dimensions; collectivist cultures are more group-oriented and therefore hold conformity to a higher level of significance than individualist cultures which rely less on the group and more on the individual
**strengths:**
- used a control group, strengthening the internal validity of the study
- standardised instructions were given in the native language of the participants, in order to minimise confusion (controlled variables)
- highly replicable
**weaknesses:** 
- lacks ecological validity (lines...)
- temporal validity; whether this still holds true today 
## KULKOFSKY ET AL 2011, c vs i and flashbulb memory
#socioculturalapproach #flashbulbmemory #culturaldimensions 
**aim:** to investigate the role of culture on flashbulb memories.
**procedure:**
- 274 adults from five countries: 
	- china
	- usa
	- uk
	- turkey
	- germany
- participants given five minutes to recall as many memories as possible of public events during their lifetime
- then they were asked questions about those events, such as "where were you when you learned of the event" and "who were you with"
- then they were asked questions about the importance of the event to them personally, such as "how personally important was the event"
**findings:**
- in collectivist cultures such as china, personal relevance and importance played less of a role in the formation of flashbulb memories compared to individualist cultures
**conclusions:**
- in individualist cultures, there is more emphasis on the individual's experiences, so the more important and relevant an event is to the individual the more likely a flashbulb memory will form
- in collectivist cultures, there is less emphasis on the individual's experiences and more emphasis on the group's; thus, individual relevance and importance is not as important in the development of a flashbulb memory
**strengths:**
- the test and the questionnaire was given in the native language of the participants (controlled variables)
- utilised back-translation to ensure the translations were accurate; increases credibility of the study
**weaknesses:** 
- ecological fallacy; just because the participant comes from the culture being studied, this doesn't mean they will share the traits of the culture's predominant dimensions
- participant variability follows after that
## ODDEN AND ROCHAT 2004, samoa and fish
#socioculturalapproach #enculturation #socialcognitivetheory 
**aim:** to investigate the role of SCT on the development of cultural norms in Samoa
**procedure/findings:**
- longitudinal study of 25 months on 28 children in one small samoan village
- through interviews and observations, they found that young males observed how the older men fished, but there was no direct instruction
	- by the age of 12 they were able to fish on their own
- no direct instruction on hierarchical structures too, but found that majority of the 12 year olds they tested were able to complete a multiple choice quiz about the rules and concepts of their society accurately
**conclusions:**
- cultural norms are not necessarily taught with direct instruction, but can also be learnt through social and cultural learning
**strengths:**
- high ecological validity?
**weaknesses:** 
- low external validity; can these findings be generalised to other cultures or even other samoan villages?
## FAGOT 1978, babies and gender roles
#socioculturalapproach #enculturation 
**aim:** to investigate the role that parents play in gender-role development
**procedure:**
- sample was 24 (white) families, 12 with a boy and 12 with a girl
- each family had a child between 20 and 24 months 
- carried out observations of interactions between parents and children; behaviours by children and reactions by parents
- each parent was asked to rate the behaviours as more appropriate for girls, for boys, or neutral
**findings:**
- boys more likely to be left alone by parents than girls
- parents gave praise to boys who played with blocks more than girls who played with blocks
- parents gave girls more negative responses when manipulating an object more than they did with boys
- parents gave more positive responses to girls than boys for playing with dolls and more negative responses to boys
- parents criticised girls more when they participated in large motor activities
- parents gave more positive responses to girls than boys when they asked for help and a more negative response to boys
**conclusions:**
- shows that children are able to learn gender roles, through their parents directly instructing them with their reactions, or social learning where the gauge the responses of their parents and react accordingly 
**strengths:**
- high ecological validity; a naturalistic study
- researcher triangulation and high inter-rater reliability; two observers were used
**weaknesses:** 
- sample bias; only white families
- demand characteristics; families knew they were being watched
## MIRANDA AND MATHENY 2000, latino immigrants in usa
#acculturation #socioculturalapproach 
**aim:** to investigate which factors in the lives of Latino immigrants to the united states would decrease the level of acculturative stress
**procedure:**
- sample of around 200 latino immigrants
- completed a questionnaire and a series of standardised tests which assessed:
	- family cohesion
	- level of acculturation
	- acculturative stress
	- coping strategies for stress
**findings/conclusions:**
- those with effective coping strategies, good proficiency in english, and strong family cohesion were <u>less likely</u> to experience acculturative stress
- those who had spent a longer time in the us were less likely to demonstrate this stress and show a higher level of acculturation
**strengths:**
- standardised questionnaires and survets
- given in their native language and removes confusion (removing confounding variable)
**weaknesses:** 
- generalisability is Low
- concept of "acculturative stress" can be subjective from person to person; same with level of english proficiency and effective coping skills etc
## LEUCK AND WILSON 2010, asian immigrants s in usa
#acculturation #socioculturalapproach 
**aim:** to investigate the variables that may predict acculturative stress in a nationally representative sample of asian immigrants and asian americans
**procedure:**
- sample: around 2000 asian americans, either first gen immigrants or born to first gen immigrants
	- included several asian cultures including chinese, filipino, vietnamese
- semi-structured interviews: interviewers had similar cultural and linguistic backgrounds to participants (to minimise lack of understanding), conducted via internet or face-to-face
	- randomly selected sample of participants was contacted to validate the data taken from their interviews
- measured:
	- level of acculturative stress
	- impact of language proficiency
	- language preference
	- discrimination
	- social networks
	- family cohesion
	- socio-economic status
**findings/conclusion:**
- 70% of participants had some level of acculturative stress
- bilingual language preference contributed to lower acculturative stress
- HOWEVER the preference for speaking english <u>only</u> is a predictor of high acculturative stress
- discrimination = high stress
- high family cohesion = less stress
- economic good = less stress
**strengths:**
- semi structured; standardised questions are asked, however further questions can be asked to expand on certain responses
- very large sample, and is diverse
**weaknesses:** 
- interviewer effects 
- potential demand characteristics
- all the values measured are subjective
## OGIHARA AND UCHIDA 2014, individualism in japan
#globalisation #socioculturalapproach 
**aim:** to investigate the effect that working in an individualistic workplace would have on the subjective well-being of Japanese women
**procedure:**
- sample consisted of 34 adult jpn women who worked for an insurance company where performance/achievement-oriented goals were posted on the walls of the offices
- participants answered surveys related to individualistic and collectivistic orientation, subjective well-being, nature of their relationships
**findings:**
- participants who were achievement-oriented scored lower on subjective well-being and had fewer close friends
**conclusions:**
- may be due to transition in jpn where globalisation is promoting individualism in the workplace while the local culture is maintaining traditional collectivistic values
**strengths:**
- 
**weaknesses:** 
- unable to directly test the causal relationships between individualistic orientation and decrease in number of close friends (bidirectional ambiguity?)
- survey was used, so potential influence by social desirability in the answers
## ARIELY 2011, globalisation and identity
#globalisation #socioculturalapproach 
**aim:** to examine the effect of globalisation on the relationship between 'constructive patriotism', 'nationalism', and xenophobic attitudes (constructive patriotism: individuals are loyal to their country, able to constructively criticise the country) (nationalism: believes that one's country is better than others and is defensive to criticism)
**procedure:**
- cross-sectional survey of over 31 countries
**findings:**
- individuals with attitudes associated with constructive patriotism were more tolerant of foreigners
- participants who were nationalistic had more xenophobic
- correlation between nationalism and xenophobia is stronger in countries with higher levels of globalisation
**conclusions:**
- nationalism is related to exclusionary reactions while constructive patriotism is related to integrative reactions
- two key reactions to globalisation:
	- <u>exclusionary reaction</u> negative reaction against another culture bcs of a perceived threat to one's local culture; occurs when identification with local culture is strong
	- <u>integrative reaction</u> sees other cultures as a resource for problem-solving; occurs when local cultural identification is weak
**strengths:**
- cross-cultural validity
**weaknesses:** 
- correlational, no cause/effect relationship established, no independent variable is manipulated
- low ecological validity
- self-reported, so social desirability bias may influence data
- doesn't show change over time; can be influenced by current situational factors
## CHIU et al 2009, exposure to culture
#globalisation #socioculturalapproach 
**aim:** to determine if exposing European American participants to another culture would increase their stereotypes about their own culture
**procedure:**
- sample was 58 European American undergraduates
- independent samples
- single condition; participants shown a Nike sports ad with male Caucasian model
- join presentation condition; participants saw the same ad placed next to an ad for a Chinese sports shoe with a group of smiling Chinese young men wearing similar clothes and facial expressions
- both conditions were asked to rate the 'likeability' of the Nike ad
- participants then took a test to measure attitudes towards dimensions associated w American and Chinese culture
**findings:**
- joint presentation condition rated Americans as much more individualistic and having control over their lives, less likely to be collectivistic, less likely to believe in the duty to family, less likely to conform to societal norms
- results strongest in individuals with high identification with their local identity
**conclusions:**
- by being exposed to the two cultures simultaneously, American identity and its values became more salient than for the single condition. 
- suggest that globalised environment may draw people's attention to their own cultural heritage
**strengths:**
**weaknesses:** 
- low ecological validity
- only focused on European Americans and Chinese
## NORASAKKUNKIT AND UCHIDA 2014, hikikomori
#globalisationandbehaviour #socioculturalapproach 
**aim:** to investigate the relationship between an individual's attitude towards collectivism and conformity to the risk of hikikomori
**procedure:**
- sample of 195 Japanese uni students
- participants given a standardised test to see whether they were at high or low risk of hikikomori
- participants given a test to measure their attitudes about social harmony and social conformity
	- looked at perception of current self, ideal self, and japanese society. measured their sense of local identity. measured sense of global identity.
**findings:**
- both groups agreed that social harmony and conformity were highly valued by japanese society
- when assessing current self/ideal self, high risk hikikomori students ranked social harmony values much lower than low-risk students
- high risk students scored lower than low risk students on both local and global identity
**conclusions:**
- local culture may alienate Japanese youth who then decide not to conform to cultural norms but do not identify with or know how to access the globalised culture so they withdraw from society - identity confusion
**strengths:**
- relatively large sample size
**weaknesses:** 
- "high risk" participants did not <u>have</u> the disorder
- no cause/effect can be established
- bidirectional ambiguity
- demand characteristics social desirability
## WEINSTEIN 1983, optimism bias
#healthpsychology #determinantsofhealth
**aim:** to investigate the relationship between optimism bias and health protective behaviours
**procedure:**
- sample: 88 undergrads (32 male 56 female)
- filled out a questionnaire about eleven health and safety risks, such as tooth decay, injury in car accident, cancer, diabetes
- participants then asked to answer question: "compared to other people of your age and sex, what are you chances of getting (the problem) - greater than, about the same, or less than theirs"
- also asked about their level of worry about the chance of developing said issue
- experimental; three conditions
- <u>first condition</u> participants just asked to fill questionnaire
- <u>second condition (own-risk)</u> before filling in questionnaire participants were given risk factors and told "in some cases these risk factors are well-established; in some it's not clear and they are just possible risk factors". participants asked to assess number of risk factors that applied to them and then filled the questionnaire
- <u>third condition</u> participants shown the same list of risk factors and told "each of the questions about risk factors has a number which shows response of a typical male/female based on data", then asked to fill questionnaire
**findings:**
- second condition (own-risk) felt that they had least chance of developing health problem, least worried of the three groups, least likely to take preventative measures
- rating oneself on risk factors substantially increased optimistic biases
- when given info about risk status of peers, optimism bias significantly reduced
**conclusions:**
- risk perception is a determinant of health - optimism bias, the lack of perceived risk, decreases the likelihood of taking protective measures against health issues
**strengths:**
- standardised questionnaire!
- three separate conditions
**weaknesses:** 
- small and biased sample (only 88, one age group only)
- correlation not causation!
## ROSEMAN ET AL 1976, type A and heart disease
#healthpsychology #determinantsofhealth 
**aim:** to investigate whether type a personality was correlated with health effects. (type A: competitive, perfectionist, overly committed to work, anger and hostility) (type B: low-stress, flexible, express emotions openly)
**procedure:**
- sample: around 3000 employed men aged 39 to 59
- quasi-experimental, looking at incidence of coronary heart disease over a period of 8.5 years
**findings:**
- 257 of participants developed coronary heart disease
	- 70% of these men were type A
	- type A nearly twice as likely to develop heart disease as type B
**conclusions:**
- coronary heart disease correlated (not caused!) with having type A personality traits
	- possibly due to cardiovascular reactivity, high in type A
**strengths:**
- controlled for variables such as smoking/lifestyle, minimising extraneous variables
**weaknesses:** 
- does not account for coping styles for stress
- external validity; all-male sample, studies with women have shown little correlation
- assumes type A and type B personalities are valid - they are a little reductionist, humans are more complex than that
## JESSOR, TURBIN, COSTA 1998, protective/risk factors
#healthpsychology #protectiveandriskfactors
**aim:** conducted a longitudinal questionnaire study on protective and risk factors in adolescent health behaviour
**procedure:**
- sample: around 1,500 students from middle schools and high schools in the US
	- 42% hispanic, 33% white non-hispanic, 24% african-american
- tested sample on level of healthy diet, adequate sleep, regular exercise, good dental hygiene, seatbelt use
- created "health-enhancing behaviour index" or HEBI
- <u>proximal risk factors</u> include friends/parents as models of negative behaviours, environmental stress, susceptibility to peer pressure
- <u>proximal protective factors</u> include friends/parents as good models for health, school health programs
- <u>distal protective factors</u> are academic performance, religion, relationship with parents/adults, prosocial activities
**findings:**
- HEBI correlated positively with socioeconomic status and negatively with age (high hebi = high socioeco and also young, low hebi = older and low socioeco)
- proximal risk/protective and distal protective factors had a significant relationship with health-related behaviour in adolescents
**conclusions:**
- the variables thus to a certain extent valid predictors of health-related behaviour
**strengths:**
- replicated study in China and obtained same results - replicability, reliability, cross-cultural validity
**weaknesses:** 
- self-reported questionnaire, so social desirability bias may affect results
## SORENSEN ET AL 1992, danish adopt bmi
#healthpsychology #protectiveandriskfactors 
**aim:** to investigate the role of genetics on BMI
**procedure:**
- sample: 840 adult Danish adoptees, used as probands (when adoptee develops a behaviour, then compared to birth parents and adoptive family)
- height and weight used to calculate current and childhood BMI
- data from birth parents and adoptive family obtained through questionnaires for more BMI calculations
- questionnaire also given about environmental factors that could contribute to obesity such as age of child and parent at time of adoption, family income, smoking habits
**findings:**
- correlations:
	- bio mother 0.17, bio father 0.16, bio siblings 0.59
	- adoptive mothers 0.10, adoptive fathers 0.03, adoptive siblings 0.14
**conclusions:**
- similar levels of correlation between adoptive and birth parents for current and maximum weight
- none of environmental factors showed any significant correlation with BMI
- thus, potential genetic influence
**strengths:**
- large sample size thus reliable
- lack of significant correlation between environmental factors and obesity means more likely it is genetic
**weaknesses:** 
- uses BMI which is not considered a good measure of obesity
- unable to identify which genes specifically affect weight if any
