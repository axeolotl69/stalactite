## MAGUIRE et al 2000, London Taxi Drivers
#localisationoffunction #neuroplasticity #rmofbiologicalapproach
**aim:** to investigate the role of the hippocampus in learning/memory in London male taxi drivers
**procedure:** 
- quasi experiment
- sample: 16 London taxi drivers (male and right-handed) and 50 non-taxi drivers (also male and right-handed)
	- taxi drivers had years of training and experience which developed their spacial recognition/awareness
- IV - taxi driver/non-taxi driver
- DV - volume of hippocampus, including their anterior, body, and posterior regions; measured by analysing MRI scans of participant's brains, analysed through pixel counting and VBM 
**findings:**
- taxi drivers had greater grey matter density in the <u>posterior hippocampus</u> compared to the control group
- positive correlation between amount of time as a taxi driver and greater volume of right posterior hippocampus (r=0.6)
- negative correlation between amount of time as a taxi driver and anterior hippocampal volume
**conclusions:**
- there are regionally specific structural differences between the hippocampi of licensed taxi drivers compared to those who are not taxi drivers
- professional dependence on navigational skills in licensed London taxi drivers is associated with a relative redistribution of grey matter in the hippocampus
- findings also indicate the possibility of local plasticity in the structure of a normal human brain which allows it to adapt in response to prolonged environmental stimuli
**strengths:**
- single blind; researcher did not know whether MRI scans belonged to taxi driver or non-taxi driver. avoids researcher bias
- ethically sound
**weaknesses:** 
- quasi experiment; only correlational findings
- sampling bias due to male population, difficult to generalise results

## HM: MILNER 1966
#rmofcognitiveapproach #localisationoffunction #multistoremodelofmemory 
**aim:** to better understand the effects that the surgery had on HM
**procedure:**
- longitudinal case study, HM had a surgery which removed tissue from medial temporal lobe (including hippocampus)
- used various different strategies, using method triangulation
	- psychometric testing; his IQ was above average
	- direct observation of his behaviour
	- interviews with HM and his family members
	- cognitive tests; memory tests and learning tasks
	- MRI to determine the extent of damage done
**findings:**
- HM could not acquire episodic or semantic knowledge; memory about events and information about world around him respectively
- he was however able to draw a picture of his house; cognitive knowledge
- had capacity for working memory; was asked to remember the number 584 and could repeat it 15 minutes after, though once the task was over HM couldn't remember it
- he knew how to mow a lawn (procedural memory)
**conclusions:**
- suggests that surgery removed brain structures which contributed to moving memories from short-term to long-term
- he could draw a photo of his house, suggesting that cognitive memory is not encoded in the same way as semantic or episodic
- suggests short-term memory is not stored in hippocampus 
- suggests that medial temporal lobe is not site of permanent storage, but organises and stores elsewhere in the brain 
**strengths:**
- longitudinal+method triangulation 
- ecological validity - less extraneous variables
- very ethically sound
**weaknesses:** 
- cannot easily be replicated
- retrospective; we did not know much about HM before the incident
- hard to generalise
