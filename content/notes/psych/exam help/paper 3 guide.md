| Identify the research method used, and outline two characteristics of the method       | 3     |
| Describe the sampling method used in the study                                         | 3     |
| Suggest an alternative or additional research method giving one reason for your choice | 3     |                                                                                       |       |
- make sure you link to the study whenever you identify something
- be specific when identifying method
## question 2
| question                                                                                                                                                                            | marks |

| Describe the ethical considerations that were applied in the study and explain if further ethical considerations could be applied                                                   | 6     |
| Describe the ethical considerations in reporting the results and explain additional ethical considerations that could be taken into account when applying the findings of the study | 6     |
- use any CARDUD that is mentioned and describe all of them
## question 3
| question                                                                         | mark |

| Discuss the possibility of generalising/transferring the findings of the study   | 9    |
| Discuss how a researcher could ensure that the results of the study are credible | 9    |
| Discuss how the researcher in the study could avoid bias                         | 9    |                                                                                 |      |
- make direct reference to the study
- remember: **generalisability** is for <u>quantitative</u> data, **transferability** is for <u>qualitative</u> data
	- <u>quantitative research</u>:
		- was there sampling bias? is the sample representative of the larger population?
		- is the sample large enough to generalise?
		- does the study have high ecological validity
	- <u>qualitative research</u>:
		- sampling bias again
		- how sampling technique may affect the ability to generalise
		- which variables would need to be the same in other settings in order to transfer results
		- consider if there are any factors that make the study/setting unique and if these are easy to replicate/transfer
- **credibility** is referring to <u>qualitative</u> research only. **validity** is discussed for <u>quantitative</u>
	- data triangulation (similar to method triangulation *but* is using different sets of data, eg from different samples or even populations)
	- researcher triangulation
	- member checking (confirming results/answers with the participants)
	- researcher credibility
	- other supporting research
- **bias** refers to human factors that may affect the results of the study.
	- peer review
	- single / double blind
	- researcher triangulation
	- how the sample is obtained
	- leading questions
	- personal reflexivity (when the researcher recognises and accounts for their own biases)
