The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of drama therapy and
art therapy on crime rates with young offenders who commit petty crime in the
Netherlands and Germany. Petty crime is defined as low-level or less-serious crime
such as stealing from shops or spraying graffiti on walls. Previous research had
suggested such therapies were not good value for the tax payer and there was a
possibility that future governments may reduce funding.

Two researchers (one male; one female), working in a university social science
department, used <u>surveys</u> to collect data from 42 experienced art therapists working in five institutions in the Netherlands and Germany who were found using <u>snowball sampling</u>. They were asked to sign <u>informed consent forms</u> and were guaranteed <u>anonymity and confidentiality</u>. The survey asked questions about the effectiveness of drama therapy and art therapy on crime rates with young offenders, which were <u>scaled from one through to five</u>. For example, one question was: How effective do you think art therapy has been on helping young offenders you have worked with transition into a non-criminal lifestyle? There was a <u>space at the end of the surveys for the participants to add further thoughts</u>. The surveys were conducted on a <u>digital internet platform</u>.

The results were published in a peer-reviewed journal and quotes from the participants were used to add support for the quantitative results. The overall results showed drama and art therapy was seen as an effective way to help
young offenders deal with their emotional problems; it reduced the chances of young offenders reoffending; it required more funding to make it more accessible for more young people. Some participants expressed concern that funding may be cut in the future and they worried about the effect on the young people they worked with.
## question 1
### Identify the research method used and outline two characteristics of the method. (3)
The research method is a survey, which includes questions and are self-reported by participants. The surveys were conducted on a digital internet platform, and participants answered close-ended questions on a scale of one through five. Space was also provided at the end of the survey for participants to add further thoughts.
### Describe the sampling method used in the study. (3)
The sampling method used in this study was snowball sampling. Once a participant is acquired, they are asked to recruit other participants which fit the sample requirements. The cycle is repeated until there are enough participants. In this study, the participants were experienced art therapists from five institutions in the Netherlands and Germany.
### Suggest an alternative or additional research method giving one reason for your choice. (3)
The researcher could have also used semi-structured interviews in addition to the surveys, where questions could be asked to expand on answers given in response to the survey. This method allows interviewers to ask further questions and explore participants' answers in more detail. Data collected from this interview with participants could be used to support data from the survey.
## question 2
### Describe the ethical considerations in reporting the results and explain additional ethical considerations that could be taken into account when applying the findings of the study. (6)
The participants were asked to sign informed consent forms, and were also guaranteed anonymity and confidentiality.
