## evolution
- the process by which organisms change from generation to generation as a result of a change in heritable characteristics
- not random but logical
- theory of <u>modern evolution</u> (combination of Darwin's theory and genetics) is based on these premises:
	- biological organisms are driven by the need to <u>survive and reproduce</u>
	- organisms having different traits are adapted to their environment to varying degrees
	- organisms who are better adapted to their environment have a better chance of surviving and producing offspring 
### natural selection
- as organisms that are less adapted stop producing and passing on their genes, these genes are lost from the gene pool
- more adpated organisms produce more offspring, so their genes in the gene pool get stronger
- charles darwin's theory of evolution:
	- states that evolution happens by natural selection
	- individuals in a species show variation in physical characteristics (genes)
- influenced by:
	- genetic mutations
	- competition (eg reousrces, food, habit, mates)
	- heritability of traits
## evolutionary psychology
- attempts to explain psychological traits or behaviours as adaptions
- also based on natural selection
- attempts to explain that human behaviours are result of development of our species over time
- natural selection <u>cannot select for a behaviour</u>, but can select for genes that may produce a behaviour
- makes an assumption that behaviours are genetic and may be inherited
## sexual selection
- a facet of natural selection, sexual selection is how the "best mate" is chosen to produce and protect the most healthy offspring
- **intrasexual selection** - competition between one sex (usually males) for access to mates; usually the "strongest" engs up being able to pass on their genes (think alpha male vs beta male)
- **intersexual selection** - members of one sex (usually females) choose members of another sex based on a specific characteristic (eg an amazing jaw line i quoted ms lionello)
