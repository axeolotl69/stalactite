title: "hormones and pheromones"
---
- chemicals that are released by specific glands in the body to <u>regulate medium and long-term behaviour changes</u>
- some also act as neurotransmitters and have a more immediate effect (eg adrenaline)
- act as chemical messengers for long-distance signalling
- travel via the circulatory system
- hormones involved in thoughts/feelings/behaviours:
	- adrenaline (adrenals, fight or flight + arousal)
	- cortisol (adrenals, arousal + stress + memory)
	- oxytocin (pituitary + hypothalamus, social recognition + mother-child attachment + attachment)
	- testosterone (gonads, development + social status via aggression)
## endocrine system
- separate from but interdependent with nervous system
- <u>network of glands</u> responsible for a wide variety of bodily functions
- major function is to <u>synthesise, regulate and release hormones</u>
- key glands include:
	- pituitary gland (control centre)
	- hypothalamus (links endocrine and nervous system)
	- pineal gland (melatonin)
	- thyroid gland (metabolism)
	- thymus (immune response)
	- adrenals (fight or flight)
	- pancreas (glucose regulation)
	- testes/ovaries (reproduction)
### oxytocin
- produced by <u>hypothalamus</u>
- released into the blood by <u></u><u>pituitary gland</u>
- plays a role in:
	- reproduction
	- childbirth
	- social bonding
- released with hugs/kiss and when mothers are breastfeeding
- can also have negative effects
