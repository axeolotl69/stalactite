## the neuron
- put in structure lol

## neurotransmitters
- more than 100 different kinds
- chemical substance produced by a neuron that carries a message to other neurons/muscle cells
- it binds to receptor sites of a postsynaptic neuron which are specialised to receive that particular neurotransmitter
- any additional neurotransmitter left in the synapse is reabsorbed by the presynaptic neuron
- <u>receptor sites</u> are located on the dendrite of the post-synaptic neuron, and have a lock and key mechanism
#### excitatory neurotransmitters
- allow the impulse to cross the synapse
- produce stimulating effects on the brain
#### inhibitory neurotransmitters
- stop the impulse, so it can't cross the synapse
- produce calming effects on the brain
#### metabotropic neurotransmitters (don't need to know)
- indirectly affects the neuron, considered neither inhibitory and excitatory
#### agonists 
- chemicals that enhance the action of a neurotransmitter
#### antagonists
- chemicals that counteract neurotransmitters, therefore preventing the message being passed further along
