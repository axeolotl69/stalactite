## the neuron
![[images/Pasted image 20230314210946.png]]
#### dendrites 
detect and receive information from other neurons; passed onto soma
- neuron's ability to form new dendrites is an example of neuroplasticity
- can have one or many dendrites, each with many branches
#### soma (cell body)
holds genetic information, provides cell with energy
#### axon
tube-like extension that transmits neural information to other neurons
#### myelin sheath
a white, fatty substance that insulates the axon to avoid interference from other acons, and increases speed of transmission of messages
#### axon terminal
at the end of the axon are small branches called axon collaterals, and at the end of those are axon terminals. each has a swollen tip called a <u>terminal button</u> (aka <u>synaptic vesicle</u>) which is a small sac-like structure that stores and secretes neurotransmitters
#### node of ranvier
are gaps in the myelin sheath, which are rich in ion channels and allow for the exchange of key ions like sodium and chloride
#### schwann cells
cells in the peripheral nervous system that produce the myelin sheath, and assist with regeneration of nerve cells 
### synaptic gap

...the tiny space where a neurotransmitter passes a chemical message from the terminal button of one neuron to the dendrites of another
-  synapes is the site where communication occurs between two neurons. three components are the synaptic gap, terminal buttons of the pre-synaptic neuron and the dendrites of the post-synaptic neuron
## neurotransmitters
- more than 100 different kinds
- chemical substance produced by a neuron that carries a message to other neurons/muscle cells
- it binds to receptor sites of a postsynaptic neuron which are specialised to receive that particular neurotransmitter
- any additional neurotransmitter left in the synapse is reabsorbed by the presynaptic neuron
- <u>receptor sites</u> are located on the dendrite of the post-synaptic neuron, and have a lock and key mechanism
#### excitatory neurotransmitters
- allow the impulse to cross the synapse
- produce stimulating effects on the brain
#### inhibitory neurotransmitters
- stop the impulse, so it can't cross the synapse
- produce calming effects on the brain
#### metabotropic neurotransmitters (don't need to know)
- indirectly affects the neuron, considered neither inhibitory and excitatory
#### agonists 
- chemicals that enhance the action of a neurotransmitter
#### antagonists
- chemicals that counteract neurotransmitters, therefore preventing the message being passed further along
