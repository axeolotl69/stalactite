title: "neuroplasticity"
---
## neuroplasticity
when the neural structure of the brain changes over time due to genetic/environmental changes
### synaptic plasticity
- smallest scale of neuroplasticity
- the ability of the neuron to form new synaptic connections and break up old ones
### cortical remapping
- largest scale of neuroplasticity
- phenomenon when brain area X takes on the functions of brain area Y eg due to injury
	- sense substitution: idea that other sense may be useful in making up for lost senses
	- human echolocation: some blind people acquire information about visual stimuli around them using echoes
## neural networking
when new neural pathways are built in the brain
## neural pruning
when neural pathways weaken over time due to inactivity
