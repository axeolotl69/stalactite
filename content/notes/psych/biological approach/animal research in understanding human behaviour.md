## animal models
- use of a <u>non-human animal</u> to study a <u>psychological</u> or <u>psychopathological</u> process that is <u>similar to a human condition</u>
- four major types of experimental manipulation used in animal models:
	- **genetic manipulation** - when animals are bred in a certain way
	- **invasive manipulation with the nervous system** - parts of the brain are stimulated with electrodes, lesioned, or removed
	- **invasive manipulations with other body parts** - may be stimulated by substances or damaged
	- **behavioural and environemental manipulations** - such as electric shots from rats in maze
## comparing human and animal brains
- relies on the assumption that human and animal brains are similar
- supports evolution theories in that as new species evolved, new structures were built on top of older structures; the deeper we go into the brain, the more "primitive" structures exist
- popular theory, **triune brain**, proposed by MacLean (1990) separates the brain into 3 parts
	- reptilian complex
	- paleomammalian complex (limbic system)
	- neocortex
- microscopic differences between in certain areas of animal and human brain
- some brain areas both humans and primates have in common were found to be different in terms of how neurons are structured
- suggests that evolution of the brain may be more complex than just building newer structures on top of old ones
- led some scientists to argue that comparison of brain differences may not give full understanding on how animals are psychologically similar, that we need to compare psychological functions too (including cognitive+social perspective)
- <span style="color:#90BE6D">pros</span>: 
	- humans/animals are identical in many ways, both in brain structure and genetically
	- allow researchers to embrace full life span (humans tend to live longer than research teams...) but animals ... will not ...
	- can be highly controlled (switch off genes etc)
	- relatively inexpensive and easily accessible, easy to handle and manage
- <span style="color:#d95950">cons</span>: 
	- animals/humans are never exactly the same, so if animal research is successful then it needs to be repeated on humans to see if findings are able to be generalised
	- even if biologically similar, animals/humans can still differ psychologically
	- since animals are tested in lab conditions, they are under stress. thus, they're not in natural environment so ecological validity is ehhh
	- humans and animals are Different
## validity of animal models
### construct validity
the behaviour of the model and features of the disorder being modelled can be unambiguously interpreted as being the same in the animal model and humans (how the experiment is designed)
### mechanistic validity
the cognitive or biological mechanisms underlying the disorder are identical in both humans and animals (is the cause the same? the context? environment?)
### face validity
observable behaviour or biological markers are indentical in both animals and humans 
### predictive validity
what triggers the symptoms or the disorder is the same for animals and humans. or may focus on treatment, that the effects of a treatment are the same in both animals and humans
## ethics
### the three R's
#### reduction
reducing the number of animals used in an experiment
- improving experimental techniques
- improving techniques of data analysis
- sharing information with other researchers
#### refinement
refining the experiment or the way animals are cared for (reducing harm)
- less invasive techniques
- better medical care
- better living/breeding conditions
#### replacement
replacing experiments on animals with alternatives
- experimenting on cell cultures instead
- computer models
- studying human volunteers
