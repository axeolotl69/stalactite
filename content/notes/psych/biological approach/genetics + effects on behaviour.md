## nature vs nurture
- debate which aims to establish whether human behaviour is determined primarily by biological factors, such as genetics and brain structure (nature), or environmental factors such as education and friends (nurture)
### epigenetics
- the study of how your behaviours and environment can change the way genes are expressed
## twin studies
- <u>monozygotic (MZ)</u> known as identical twins, come from the same egg
- <u>dizygotic (DZ)</u> known as fraternal, from separate eggs
## family studies
- aka <u>kinship/pedigree studies</u>
- looks at concordance rate of a behaviour within a family across generations
- therefore concordance rates will increase if heritability is high and vice versa
## adoption studies
- compare adopted children to their adoptive parents, bioligical parents, adoptive siblings and biological siblings
- genetic link can be inferred if adopted children are more similar to their biological parents than their adoptive parents
- should allow for the most direct comparison of genetic and environemntal influences on behaviour
