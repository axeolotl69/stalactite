title: "genetics"

## nature vs nurture
- debate which aims to establish whether human behaviour is determined primarily by biological factors, such as genetics and brain structure (nature), or environmental factors such as education and friends (nurture)
### epigenetics
- the study of how your behaviours and environment can change the way genes are expressed
## ways to study genetics
### twin studies
- <u>monozygotic (MZ)</u> known as identical twins, come from the same egg
- <u>dizygotic (DZ)</u> known as fraternal, from separate eggs
- <span style="color:#90BE6D">allows researchers to study the effect of the environment, as DZ twins have different DNA</span>
- <span style="color:#d95950">non-representative sample, DZ twins still share DNA so concordance rates may be affected as such</span>
### family studies
- aka <u>kinship/pedigree studies</u>
- looks at concordance rate of a behaviour within a family across generations
- therefore concordance rates will increase if heritability is high and vice versa
- <span style="color:#90BE6D">more representative of general population than twin studies, allows for similarity and culture</span> 
- <span style="color:#d95950">members of family often share an environment, data is often based on assumptions</span>
### adoption studies
- compare adopted children to their adoptive parents, bioligical parents, adoptive siblings and biological siblings
- genetic link can be inferred if adopted children are more similar to their biological parents than their adoptive parents
- should allow for the most direct comparison of genetic and environemntal influences on behaviour
- <span style="color:#90BE6D">allows researchers to isolate variables</span>
- <span style="color:#d95950">children often placed into families with similar cultures/background as biological parents, not representative of all children</span>
### linkage analysis
- completed through genetic mapping (ascertaining which gene is involved in a behaviour and where it is located on the chromosome) and researchers examine the DNA for polymorphisms (presence of genetic variation)
- <span style="color:#90BE6D">direct measure of genetic heritability, identifies specific genes</span>
- <span style="color:#d95950">expensive, and because expensive it's not representative as not many people have done/can do it</span>
## genetic similarity
- referred to as the relatedness, and it is assumed the greater the genetic similarities between two or more individuals, the higher the degree of relatedness
- is measurable, and is known as the coefficient of the relationship between two individuals
## major depressive disorder
- low motivation, little/less interest in things/hobbies, low mood/mood swings, insomnia, change in weight, struggles in focus and decision making 
- refer to as such not just depression
