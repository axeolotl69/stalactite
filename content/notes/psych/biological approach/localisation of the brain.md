title: "localisation of the brain"
---

...<mark style="background: #90BE6D;">the concept that different parts of the brain have different functions</mark>
### relative localisation
- the idea that specific parts of the brain may be responsible for certain functions but not exclusively; other parts may also assist in the functioning
- examples include ???
### strict localisation
- the idea that each function is specific to one part of the brain
- examples include [[notes/psych/biological approach/brain function#broca's area|broca's area]] and [[notes/psych/biological approach/brain function#wernicke's area|wernicke's area]] 
### lateralisation
- the idea that (some) functions in the brain are specific to one hemisphere (under the localisation umbrella)
- sperry and gazzaniga researched 4 split brain patients (patients whose corpus callosum had been surgically cut to reduce severe epilepsy) 
	- aim was to test the theory of lateralisation and to see if two hemispheres have uniquely different functions
	- when a picture of a spoon was shown to the left visual field, and ask to name/describe what they saw, patients said nothing, but when asked to pick up the object they did so successfully - **supports that lateralisation of language is in the left hemisphere**
	- when a simple word (eg pencil) was flashed to the right hemisphere, patients were able to pick the pencil from the group of objects - **supports that language production <u>is not exclusive</u> to the left hemisphere** 
### other terms
- <mark style="background: #F9C74F;">principle of mass action</mark> - based on a correlation observed between the percentage of cortex removed, and learning abilities: less cortex removed, slower and more inefficient the learning
- <mark style="background: #F9C74F;">equipotentiality</mark> - refers to the ability of one part of the cortex to take over the functions of another part of the cortex
