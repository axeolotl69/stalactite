#### structural imaging
focuses on what parts of the brain look like in relation to each other
#### functional imaging
focuses on how the brain works, in terms of its physiology
#### spatial resolution
ability to discriminate between nearby locations; higher spatial res = clearer image
#### temporal resolution
the smallest amount of time in which changes in brain activity can be registered

## CAT (computerised axial tomography) scans
- structural
- x rays at many angles, hard and soft tissue
- <mark style="background: #90BE6D;">quick, non-invasive</mark>
- <mark style="background: #d95950;">exposure to radiation</mark>
## MRI 
- structural
- detects changes in blood flow with very strong magnets
- <mark style="background: #90BE6D;">non-invasive, relatively inexpensive</mark>
- <mark style="background: #d95950;">low spatial res, claustrophobia, takes a while, can't use w medical implants</mark>
## PET (positron emmission tomography) scan
- functional 
- measures glucose in the brain
- <mark style="background: #90BE6D;">good spatial res</mark>
- <mark style="background: #d95950;">invasive (small injection), poor temporal res, expensive</mark>
## fMRI
- functional
- more active parts of the brain need more oxygen, so it measures oxygen levels in the brain
- <mark style="background: #d95950;">can't use w medical implants</mark>
## EEG (electroencephalography)
- functional
- measures electrical potentials in the brain 
- <mark style="background: #90BE6D;">great temporal res, low cost, non-invasive</mark>
- <mark style="background: #d95950;">poor spatial res, doesn't help w localisation</mark>
