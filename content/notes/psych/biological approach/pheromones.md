title: "pheromones"

#### pheromones
...are a chemical substance produced and released into the environment by an animal affecting the behaviour or physiology of others of its own species.
- shown to play a role in the behaviour of mammals, mainly in mating behaviour
- <u>no known pheromones that exist for humans</u>
- pheromones are signals that are common for all males or females of a species; they exist in all animals, including mammals
- responses to pheromones are innate and are generally not influenced by learning
### kinds of pheromones:
- some pheromones produce both releaser and primer effects, like attraction and puberty
#### releaser pheromones:
- produce short term behavioural changes, and act as attractants or repellents
#### primer pheromones
- produce long-lasting changes in behaviour, or development
### vomeronasal organ
- mammals have a vomeronasal organ (VNO), which connects to a special region in the brain called the accessory olfactory bulb where pheromones aer thought to be processed
- human featuses have a VNO, but most current evidence holds that it is functionally inactive after birth
## possible human pheromones
- do exist in the body, but impact on behaviour is dubious
- evidence for influence of pheromones on human behaviour has been inconclusive
#### androstadienone (and)
- derivative of testosterone and one of the chemical components of sweat
- present in male sweat
- can be detected by women
#### estatenenol (est)
- best known candidate for human sex pheromone, thought to signal gender and effect mate perception
- found in the urine of pregnant women
## major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
- in a study by [[notes/psych/key studies#WEDEKIND et al 1995|wedekind]] it mentions MHC
- Not a pheromone but good to know!
- basically it's a group of genes related to the immune system within humans
- there are two classes, class 1 and 2, and wedekind suggests that humans are more likely to think someone is more attractive if they have the MHC that they <u>don't</u> have, ie. someone with class 1 will think someone with class 2 is more attractive
- because reproduction is all about variety right!
