title: "pheromones"
---
- chemicals secreted outside of the body
- shown to play a role in the behaviour of mammals, mainly in mating behaviour
- <u>no known pheromones that exist for humans</u>
- pheromones are signals that are common for all males or females of a species; they exist in all animals, including mammals
- responses to pheromones are innate and are generally not influenced by learning
### kinds of pheromones:
- some pheromones produce both releaser and primer effects, like attraction and puberty
#### releaser pheromones:
- produce short term behavioural changes, and act as attractants or repellents
#### primer pheromones
- produce long-lasting changes in behaviour, or development
### vomeronasal organ
- mammals have a vomeronasal organ (VNO), which connects to a special region in the brain called the accessory olfactory bulb where pheromones aer thought to be processed
- human featuses have a VNO, but most current evidence holds that it is functionally inactive after birth
## possible human pheromones
- do exist in the body, but impact on behaviour is dubious
- evidence for influence of pheromones on human behaviour has been inconclusive
#### androstadienone (and)
- derivative of testosterone and one of the chemical components of sweat
- present in male sweat
- can be detected by women
#### estatenenol (est)
- best known candidate for human sex pheromone, thought to signal gender and effect mate perception
- found in the urine of pregnant women
