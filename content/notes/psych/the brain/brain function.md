title: "brain function"
---
- a mass of networked cells
- cerebral cortex is the <u>most prominent</u> part when looking at the brain
- many important functions are controlled by areas <u>beneath the cortex</u>
- parts of the brain can be classified in different ways
	- eg forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain, lobes

> [!note] localisation of function
> the concept that different parts of the brain have different functions; proposed by Franz Gall towards the end of the 18th century
- currently, neuroscience supports **relative localisation;** admits localisation for some functions under some conditions, but clearly outlines its limits
> [!warning] research opposing localisation
> karl lashley did smth with rats and concluded that memory was distributed rather than localised (ok dude)
- <mark style="background: #F9C74F;">principle of mass action</mark> - based on a correlation observed between the percentage of cortex removed, and learning abilities: less cortex removed, slower and more inefficient the learning
- <mark style="background: #F9C74F;">equipotentiality</mark> - refers to the ability of one part of the cortex to take over the functions of another part of the cortex
## hindbrain
- located at the base of the brain around the brainstem
- is a collection of lower level brain structures that include the cerebellum, medulla and pons
- responsible for controlling or influencing various motor function and vital automatic responses such as breathing and heart rate, sleep, arousal
### cerebellum
- <mark style="background: #90BE6D;">cauliflower-like shape at the base of the brain</mark>, looks like a mini brain. about the size of a tennis ball in an adult brain
- coordinates <u>fine muscle movements</u> and regulates posture + balance
- organises and adjusts muscle activity to ensure movement is smooth and precise, and so it's mostly automatic
- involved in activities requiring <u>rapid and skilled</u> sequence of movements, like speaking and touch-typing
- active when learning new movements
- also involved in learning and memory associated with movement
### medulla
- continuation of spinal cord; <mark style="background: #90BE6D;">connects spinal cord to brain</mark>
- controls <u>vital body functions</u> like swallowing, breathing, heart rate, blood pressure, vomiting, salivating, coughing, sneezing
- some parts also involved in sensations like touch, pressure, vibration
### pons
- small structure of neural tissue <mark style="background: #90BE6D;">located just above medulla</mark>
- involved in <u>sleep, dreaming, arousal from sleep</u>
- helps to control breathing and coordination of some muscle movements
- connects parts of brain with each other by <u>relaying messages</u> between cerebral cortex and cerebellum, and between medulla and midbrain
	- eg information from ear enters brain from pons, then messages for voluntary movements are passed on from the motor areas of the cerebral cortex to the cerebellum
## midbrain
- <mark style="background: #90BE6D;">central part of the brain</mark>
- approximately 2.5cm long; contains <u>neural pathways that connect</u> upper and lower brain areas
- collection of structures involved with movement, processing of visual, auditory, and tactile sensory information, sleep and arousal
- receives large amounts of information from the <u>eyes and ears</u> to be processed
## forebrain
- <mark style="background: #90BE6D;">largest and most prominent part of the brain</mark>
- <u>regulates complex cognitive processes</u> like thinking, learning, memory, perception
- also involved in various aspects of emotion and personality
### hypothalamus
- located <mark style="background: #90BE6D;">below thalamus and above pituitary gland; above brainstem</mark>
- plays a vital role in maintaining the body's internal environment, takes part in numerous behaviours
- main functions include:
	- <u>regulating the release of hormones</u> from various glands in the body (through it's control of pituitary gland)
	- <u> influencing behaviour associated with basic biological need</u>s such as hunger, thirst, and sleep
- part of the limbic system, so also involved in emotions
### thalamus 
- located in the <mark style="background: #90BE6D;">center of the brain</mark>, a 3cm long structure that is comprised of two oval-shaped parts (one in each hemisphere)
- filters information from almost all sense receptor sites (excluding the nose) and passes it to relevant areas of the brain for further processing; <u>functions like a relay station</u>
- <u>passes information from the cerebral cortex</u> to lower brain structures, spinal cord, peripheral nerves
- also thought to pay a role in attention, regulating arousal
### cerebrum
- located <mark style="background: #90BE6D;">above and in front of cerebellum</mark>, occupies most of the forebrain
- consists of an <u>outer cerebral cortex</u>, and masses of neural tissue where neurons form connections with each other + <u>receive and process incoming and outgoing information</u>
- primarily responsible for everything we <u>consciously think, feel, do</u>
- divided into <u>two hemispheres (left + right)</u> 
	- connected, largely by corpus callosum, which enables information exchange and coordinated functioning of the brain
	- hemispheres can be further subdivded into four areas called <u>lobes</u>
### cerebral cortex
- <u>outer layer of the brain</u>
- wrinkled and folded so it can fit into a small space
- involved with more <u>complex mental abilities</u> such as perception, learning, memory, language, thinking, problem solving
- processes incoming sensory information and is involved in the planning of voluntary bodily movements
- areas and functions can be generally classified into three main areas:
1. <mark style="background: #90BE6D;">sensory areas</mark> - which receive and process sensory information
2. <mark style="background: #90BE6D;">motor areas</mark> - initiate voluntary movements
3. <mark style="background: #90BE6D;">association areas</mark> - which surround sensory and motor areas and deal with more complex functions that require integration from different areas
#### hemispheric specialisation
- the idea that <u>one hemisphere has specialised functions or exerts greater control over a particular function</u>
- **left hemisphere:** verbal + analytical functions
	- verbal functions - reading, writing, speaking etc
	- analytical functions - logical reasoning, critical evaluation, experimental design
- **right hemisphere:** non verbal functions
	- spatial and visual thinking
	- recognising patterns, faces, tunes
	- creative thinking
	- emotions
## cortical lobes of the cerebral cortex
-  areas of the cerebral cortex that are associated with different functions
- each hemisphere has four lobes:
### frontal lobe
- largest of four lobes, located in <mark style="background: #90BE6D;">upper forward half of each hemisphere</mark>
- responsible for planning and initiating voluntary bodily movements
- can be further devided into:
#### prefrontal cortex
- located <mark style="background: #90BE6D;">at the front, behind the forehead</mark>
- involved with <u>sophisticated mental abilities</u> like reasoning, planning, problem solving, decision making, symbolic thinking
- also involved with attention, <u>regulation and expression of emotions</u>, self-awareness, aspects of personality
- <u>plans required motor sequence</u>, then sense instructions to premotor cortex â†’ prepares appropriate movement sequence and sends info to primary motor cortex
#### primary motor cortex
- initiates + <u>controls voluntary movements </u>through its control of skeletal muscles
- in the **left frontal lobe**, controls voluntary movements on the **right side**, vice versa
- different areas are involved with movement of each specific body part
- amount dedicated to a body part depends on complexity/finesse of movement
#### parietal lobe
- located <mark style="background: #90BE6D;">behind frontal lobe</mark>, occupying the upper back half of the brain (excluding rearmost area)
- receives and <u>processes bodily/somatosensory information</u> such as touch, temperature, information of muscle movement and body's position
- the **primary somatosensorycortex** receives and processes sensory information from the skin and body parts
#### occipital lobe
- located at the <mark style="background: #90BE6D;">rearmost of each hemisphere</mark>
- almost exclusively devoted to sense of <u>vision</u>
- largest area of the occipital lobe is primary visual cortex which is the major destination of visual information from both eyes
#### temporal lobe
- located in the <mark style="background: #90BE6D;">lower, central area of the brain, above and around the top of each ear</mark>
- involved with <u>auditory perception</u>, and plays an important role in memory, aspects of visual perception (identifying objects/faces) and emotional responses to sensory information and memories
- **primary auditory cortex** receives and processes sound from both ears
- <mark style="background: #4D908E;">broca's area</mark>
	- case study of "tan" 1861
	- louis leborgne lost ability to speak at age 30, only able t pronounce "tan". all other intellectual capacities remained
	- loss of articulated speech is now known as Broca's aphasia
	- autopsy revealed lesion in the frontal area of the <mark style="background: #90BE6D;">left hemisphere</mark>
- <mark style="background: #4D908E;">wernicke's area</mark>
	- located in the <mark style="background: #90BE6D;">temporal lobe of dominant hemisphere</mark>
	- responsible for <u>comprehension of written and spoken language</u>
	- people with wernicke's aphasia have a general impairment of language comprehension, but speech is still intact
