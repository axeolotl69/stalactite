<mark style="background: #4D908E;">IV</mark> - variable that is systematically manipulated or changed in some way by the researcher in order to measure its effect on the dependent variable

<mark style="background: #4D908E;">DV</mark> -  variable that is used to observe and measure the effects of the independent variable, the aspect of a participant’s behaviour or experience that is assumed and expected to change as a result of the manipulation of the independent variable.

basically cause = IV and effect is DV

<mark style="background: #4D908E;">extraneous variables</mark> - any variable other than the IV that can cause a change in the DV and therefore affect the results of the experiment in an unwanted way
- might not change the DV, is still an issue

<mark style="background: #4D908E;">confounding variables</mark> - a variable other than the IV that <u>has had</u> an unwanted effect on the DV, making it impossible to determine which of the variables has produced the change in the DV
- makes a change in the DV which is consistent with the prediction within the hypothesis - so we don't know if the hypothesis is true or if another variable has influenced it (wow so <u>con</u>founding)

## identifying extraneous and/or confounding variables
### placebo effect
change in participant response or behaviour due to the belief that they are receiving a particular treatment, rather than the effect of the IV

### order effect
where the performance from participants are influenced by the order of which tasks, conditions, or treatments are presented, rather than by the IV
two types:
- practice
- carry-over

### non-standardised procedures
the difference in procedures shown to one experimental group/participant compared to another may influence the results (DV), rather than being influenced by the IV

### individual participant differences
individual differences between participants (eg age, race, gender, height) can change the results of the experiment through their varied responses

### experimenter effect
unwanted influence on participant performance by the person carrying out the research
- includes verbal cues, non-verbal cues, hints etc
- experimenter bias is the experimenter's misinterpretation or misreading of results from the experiment

## ways to minimise confounding and/or confounding variables
### participant selection and allocation
refer to [[types of sampling]]
- random allocation/assignment
	- used to place participants in groups or conditions so they are as likely to be in one as the other

### counterbalancing
involves systematically changing the order of treatment or tasks in a balanced way to counter unwanted effects on performance 
- can somewhat control the effects of [[#identifying extraneous and/or confounding variables#order effect |order effect]]

### single/double blind procedures
- single: whereby the participants are unaware of the condition of the experiment they are being allocated to
	- helps control [[#identifying extraneous and/or confounding variables#placebo effect|placebo effect]]
	- cannot always be done
- double: whereby participants and the researcher are unaware to the conditions the participants are exposed to; only researchers removed from the research itself know
	- helps control placebo effect + experimenter effect + experimenter bias

### placebos
any type of inert (inactive) treatment. given to the control group to minimise [[#identifying extraneous and/or confounding variables#placebo effect|placebo effect]], because it allows both/all groups to have the same expectations

### standardised procedures and instructions
minimises [[#identifying extraneous and/or confounding variables#non-standardised procedures|non-standardised procedures]] ... self explanatory
