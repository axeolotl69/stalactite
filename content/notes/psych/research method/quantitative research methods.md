- experiments are most widely used
- <u>goal:</u> to determine whether a cause-and-effect exists between two variables

### field experiments
- <mark style="background: #90BE6D;">studies done outside of the labratory or in the "real world"</mark>
- <u>two key limitations</u>
	- cannot control for extraneous variables
	- cannot be easily replicated
- <u>ethical concerns:</u> often not practical to get informed consent + debrief

### quasi and natural experiments
- <mark style="background: #90BE6D;">participants are <u>not</u> randomly allocated to conditions</mark>
- in quasi-experiments participants are grouped <mark style="background: #90BE6D;">based on a trait or behaviour</mark>
	- eg one group has depression and one does not
	- other common IVs used include gender, culture, age
- natural experiments - <mark style="background: #90BE6D;">refers to an independent variable that in environmental in nature and outside of the control of the researcher</mark>
	- most natural experiments work on a pre-test, post-test design; behaviour is measured both before and after the variable was introduced
- both <u>do not show direct causation</u>, but they are able to imply a causal relationship between IV and DV

### correlational studies
- take place when an experiment cannot be carried out, but data are collected which show a relationship between two variables
	- when one variable changes, another variable changes with it
- a positive correlation is when both variables are affected in the same way; as x increases y increases
- a negative correlation means that as one variable increases, the other decreases
- no independent variable is manipulated, so <u>no cause and effect relationship can be determined</u>
- <mark style="background: #90BE6D;">bidirectional ambiguity</mark> is seen in correlational research; since no independent variable is manipulated, it is impossible to know if x causes y or vice versa, or if it's coincidental or due to a third variable

## factors to consider when evaluating experiments
- [[notes/psych/research method/variables#identifying extraneous and/or confounding variables|extraneous and confounding variables]]  - undesirable variables that influence the relationship between the DV and IV
### demand characteristics
 - occur when participants act differently simply because they know they're in a study; they might try to guess the aims of the study and act accordingly
	- <mark style="background: #d96d3f;">expectancy effect:</mark> the participant attempts to discern the experimenter's hypotheses with the goal of "helping" the researcher
	- <mark style="background: #d96d3f;">screw you effect:</mark> participant attempts to discern the experimenter's hypotheses, but only in order to destroy the credibility of the study
	- <mark style="background: #d96d3f;">social desirability effect:</mark> participant answers in a way that makes them look good to the researcher, to avoid embarrassment or judgement
### researcher bias
- when experimenter sees what they're looking for; the expectations of the researcher consciously or unconsciously affect the findings of the study
- avoided by using [[notes/psych/research method/variables#single/double blind procedures|double blind procedures]] 

### participant variability
- a limitation of a study when the characteristics of the sample affect the DV
- can be controlled through [[notes/psych/research method/types of sampling#random sampling|random sampling]] and random allocation

### artificiality
- when situation created is so unlikely to occur that one has to wonder if there is any validitiy in the findings

# qualitative research methods
- used to produce <u>descriptive data</u> which is used to gain an understanding of underlying reasons, opinions, and motivations for an individual or group's behaviour
- research generally takes place in <u>natural settings</u>
- normally guided by one or more research questions; an open ended question which invites detailed descriptions, and if possible explanations
- <u>goal:</u> not to identify cause and effect, but rather to <u>describe the meanings attributed to events</u> by the research participants themselves
- use an **inductive** approach - researchers don't normally define variables in advance because this might express the researcher's ideas more than the participant's. instead, they <u>first gather the data</u> and then see what these could mean

### interviews
- one of the most common ways of collecting qualitative data
- can take many different formats and vary in time and number of questions
- can be highly or loosely structured
- requires high level social and verbal skills
- <mark style="background: #d96d3f;">social desirability bias</mark> can be an issue (refer to [[#demand characteristics|demand characteristics]]) so they might not tell the truth
- <mark style="background: #90BE6D;">structured interviews</mark>
	- the interview schedule states exactly what questions should be asked and in what order
	- highly controlled
	- reasonable to have a large sample size
	- may appear somewhat artificial
- <mark style="background: #90BE6D;">unstructured interviews</mark>
	- interview schedule only specifies the topic and time
	- open to the interests and motivation of interviewee, allowing them to reveal more about themselves; results may be seen as more valid than a highly structured interview
	- with a larger sample, data may be more difficult to analyse
- <mark style="background: #90BE6D;">semi-structured interviews</mark>
	- often preferred in modern psychology
	- interview follows a schedule of open-ended questions that allow the responder to answer freely whilst maintaining the focus of the interview
	- interviewers are able to ask further questions to explore things in more detail
- <mark style="background: #90BE6D;">focus group interviews</mark>
	- <u>advantages:</u> can be more natural than one-on-one, listening to others may spark ideas and promote further involvement in the conversation, can save time
	- <u>disadvantages:</u> those with a strong voice may be intimidating and prevent others from participating, <mark style="background: #d96d3f;">conformity effect</mark> 
### observations
- data collection method that aims to <u>describe behaviour without trying to establish cause and effect relationships</u>
- most take place in a natural setting and are called <mark style="background: #90BE6D;">naturalistic observations</mark>, as opposed to <mark style="background: #90BE6D;">labratory observations</mark>
- <u>challenges:</u>
	- impossible to observe everything in an observational field - strong research question + well trained team are essential
	- important to try and avoid [[#researcher bias]]; to overcome this, several observers can observe the same behaviour and compare results, known as <mark style="background: #d96d3f;">research triangulation</mark>
- types of observations:
	- <mark style="background: #90BE6D;">participant observation</mark> - the researcher is part of the group that is being observed
	- <mark style="background: #90BE6D;">non-participant observation</mark> - the researcher is not part of the group
- participants may not act normally when they know they are observed - known as <mark style="background: #d96d3f;">reactivity</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #90BE6D;">covert observations</mark> - participant does not know they are being observed
	- <mark style="background: #90BE6D;">overt observations</mark> - the participants know the observer is a researcher
### surveys
- relatively simple and straightforward approach to the study of attitudes, beliefs, values, motives
- extremely efficient at providing large amounts of data at a low cost, in a short period of time
- may combine qualitative and quantitative data, or only use quantitative
- often use questionnaires with closed questions to make it easier to do a statistical analysis such as a <mark style="background: #d96d3f;">Likert scale</mark> (never, seldom, sometimes, often, always etc)
- open ended questions can be used, but this takes more time to analyse
### case studies
- not a research method itself, but rather an approach to the study of something unique - the case
- can be <mark style="background: #90BE6D;">longitudinal</mark> or <mark style="background: #90BE6D;">cross-sectional</mark>
- use <mark style="background: #d96d3f;">triangulation</mark> in order to increase validity - includes <mark style="background: #d96d3f;">method and data triangulation</mark>
	- method triangulation: using multiple methods of investigation to explore the same phenomenon
- case studies are holistic and naturalistic
	- <mark style="background: #d96d3f;">holistic:</mark> often concerned with descriptions of people's experiences, feelings, or thoughts about a topic under investigation, but can also include measurements like blood testing, IQ scores, or survey data
- may be retrospective (looking at past behaviour) or prospective (looking at behaviour from the beginning of a case study into the future)
- often focuses on a limited aspect of behaviour
- <u>limitations:</u> 
	- it is not possible to replicate the findings of a case study because of the uniqueness of the case being studied - reliability of data is said to be low. 
	- generally it's not possible to generalise the results of a unique case to the general population, since the individual studied is not representative
