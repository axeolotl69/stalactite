### independent samples/independent measures design
- uses two separate group of participants, one is assigned to control and one is assigned to experimental or treatment condition
	- <u>advantages:</u> very quick and easy and reduces participant attrition (loss), no order effects between conditions to control 
	- <u>disadvantages:</u> need for a larger number of participants to ensure spread of participant variables within the sample will match the distribution within the population, less control over participant variables 

### matched pairs design
- each participant in one condition "matches" a participant in the other condition(s) on one or more participant variables of relevance to the experiment
- eg two people of the same height are split into control and one goes to experimental or treatment
	- <u>advantages:</u> no order effects, participant loss is less common
	- <u>disadvantages:</u> difficult to know which variables to match, pre-testing can create order effects, time consuming, loss of one participant means attrition of their pairs/trios etc

### repeated measures design
- same group of participants are exposed to two or more conditions and the conditions are compared
- aka "in subject" designs
	- <u>advantages:</u> can effectively control potential confounding variables
	- <u>disadvantages:</u> [[notes/psych/research method/variables#order effect|order effect]] where participants may get used to conditions (use [[notes/psych/research method/variables#counterbalancing|counterbalancing]] to...counter this)

### cross-sectional studies
- compares different groups of participants on one or more variables of interest at a single point in time
- all data collected at the same time or within a short time frame
- not true experiments because participants cannot be randomly allocated to groups 
	- <u>advantages:</u> used to effectively study change over time, simple, less time consuming, less expensive
	- <u>disadvantages:</u> cause-effect between variables cannot be fully tested, very little control over extraneous variables, cohort effect (where groups are born in significantly different times, and members of each group have shared life experiences relating to social or cultural events; think gen z vs gen x)
