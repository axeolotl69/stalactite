## testable
is the theory testable and falsifiable? can the theory be tested using standardised experimental methods?
## empirical evidence
evidence supporting the theory should be replicable and grounded in scientific research, not post-hoc or anecdotal
## applicable
should be applicable to different situations and inform practice irl
## construct validity
theories operationalise psychological constructs (phenomena) based on observations; it the theory truly testing/measuring the construct it intends on testing? does it clearly and accurately define the construct
## unbiased
is the evidence unbiased in its methodology and sample; is the sample representative
## predictive validity
good theories should be able to not just describe, but also predict behaviour. does the theory outline specific conditions under which the behaviour can occur
