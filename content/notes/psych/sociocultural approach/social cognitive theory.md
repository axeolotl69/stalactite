title: social cognitive theory
---
- states that we learn behaviours vicariously (from others)
## attention
- learner must pay attention to the model (who is demonstrating the behaviour)
- attention may be paid because of attractiveness or authority of model, or desirability of behaviour
## retention
- observer must be able to remember the behaviour
## motivation
- must want to replicate the behaviour they have observed
- must understand potential outcome of repeating the behaviour
## reproduction
- be physically and/or mentally able to carry out the behaviour
## other factors
- model stands out in contrast to others
- behaviour must be consistent
- model is liked and respected by observer
- observer perceives a similarity between themselves and the model (member of in-group)
- model's behaviour is reinforced
