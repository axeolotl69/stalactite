**in-group** when people consider that they belong to a group, this group becomes an in-group
**out-group** do not belong to the in-groups

1. social categorisation
   - categorising people into groups
2. social identification
   - identifying as part of a group
3. social comparison
   - comparing the in-group to the out-group
