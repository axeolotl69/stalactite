title: enculturation + acculturation
---
## enculturation
- process by which people <u>learn</u> the necessary and appropriate skills and norms in the context of their culture
- can occur through:
	- direct instruction (parents telling children how to behave, induction at a workplace)
	- social learning ([[notes/psych/sociocultural approach/social cognitive theory|SCT]])
	- cultural learning (new group members trying to see a situation in the same way other group members see it)
## acculturation
- the process by which people <u>change</u> as a result of contact with other cultures in order to assimilate with a new culture
- when people begin to adopt the norms and behaviours of another culture
- can connect to [[notes/psych/sociocultural approach/social identity theory|SIT]]
- berry 2008 argues that individuals can adopt four strategies for cultural change:
	- **assimilation**, where individuals are open to change and are unconcerned about loss of their original culture
	- **integration**, when individuals want to hold onto traditional values/beliefs, but at the same time desire daily interactions with other cultures
	- **separation**, actively avoid other cultures and are averse to losing their original culture
	- **marginalisation**, when individuals have little interest in maintaining their original culture, but also little interest in opening relations with other cultures
### acculturative stress
- the psychological impact of adaption or **acculturation** to a new culture.
