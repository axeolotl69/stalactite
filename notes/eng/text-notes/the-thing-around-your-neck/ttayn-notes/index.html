and he says &ldquo;of course not&rdquo; as they&rsquo;re walking. to the police station because the police think he&rsquo;s in a cult</li><li>a shooting happened with some cult members during the day and there was a curfew. nnamabia did not meet the curfew and later got arrested</li><li>erm apparently he slipped money up his ass so that he&rsquo;d have some in jail???</li><li>father says that he&rsquo;s different in jail, that it&rsquo;s shaken him; mc doesn&rsquo;t see it</li><li>nnamabia has nightmares about Cell One, which is supposedly the worst cell</li><li>ok so one day mc is like &ldquo;how about we Don&rsquo;t visit nnamabia for once&rdquo; because it takes too much petrol. and it turns into a fight so much so that mc chucks a stone at a car window, both her parents angry at her now - juxtaposed to how they react when nnamabia is in Literal Jail</li><li>mc sees this as a victory</li><li>nnamabia is showing signs of empathy!! there&rsquo;s an old guy in jail because his son is wnated but they can&rsquo;t find him (wow so justice) and he feels bad for the guy because &ldquo;he did nothing wrong&rdquo; and then his mother is like &ldquo;but so did you&rdquo; and LMFAOAOO</li><li>next day nnamabia is to be released but when they go to pick him up apparently he&rsquo;s been transferred cuz he misbehaved and got put in cell one and then ppl in cell one got transferred</li><li>&ldquo;misbehave&rdquo; he stood up for the old man god bless anyways nnamabia is okay now the end</li><li><strong>notes from panel:</strong><ul><li>&ldquo;matter of fact&rdquo; voice since the narrator is younger, limiting view of the story</li><li>mother&rsquo;s bias towards nnamabia could be a cultural thing</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>imitation<ul><li>mc nkem is on call with her friend ijemamaka, who casually drops the news that her husband obiora has a girlfriend. from her tone it seems like this is normalised, mentioning that ‚Äúthis is what happens when you marry a rich man‚Äù, but nkem is still surprised</li><li>she is a mother to multiple children, moved to america bcs Rich Men</li><li>she feels possessive of obiora in a sense</li><li>has a conversation with their &ldquo;houseworker&rdquo; of sorts, amaechi, and she says &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve known he&rsquo;s had girlfriends all along&rdquo; or smth</li><li>nothing much happens tbh except obiora comes home and nkem washes his back (mitski) saying &ldquo;we&rsquo;re moving back to lagos!&rdquo; and he&rsquo;s like &ldquo;hahhaha What&rdquo;</li><li><strong>notes from panel:</strong><ul><li>it can be viewed as nkem finding herself and realising how women are treated in their culture</li><li>prior to this she had almost denied her past</li><li>the title ‚Äúimitation‚Äù is both a reference to a perfect imitation of a mask his husband gave her, and how nkem is trying to imitate what a big man&rsquo;s wife <em>should</em> look like. she also describes her white neighbours as ‚Äúplastic‚Äù, yet she herself leads a life similar to theirs</li><li>the whole story is about nkem reflecting on her life choices</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>a private experience<ul><li>chika who goes to visit her aunty but there&rsquo;s a riot</li><li>during this she separates with her sister, who is never seen again</li><li>muslim woman offers shelter, they both bond</li><li>chika (who is studying med) helps the woman with some health issues</li><li>kind of about how chika and the woman are separated by christianity and islam, and though the people around her talk badly about the muslim people she remembers this one experience she had with a kind muslim lady</li><li><strong>panel notes:</strong><ul><li>chika in the beginning almost pities the woman, rather than look down on her</li><li>chika feels very alienated from this situation, she&rsquo;s only seen riots in films, but the woman acts like this happens often. this shows a large difference in both their lives</li><li>they both bond over the loss of a loved one; chika lost her sister, the woman lost her daughter</li><li>it&rsquo;s sort of about overcoming the bias that media and social stereotypes put on various social groups, in this case islam, and how these humane experiences in the middle of such inhumane circumstances can really stand out</li><li>gives us a new perspective into the religious aspect and political aspect of nigeria</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>ghosts<ul><li>we get backstory on the war, his relationship</li><li>it&rsquo;s in single perspective so it&rsquo;s very vague on whether what we&rsquo;re hearing from him is real or not</li><li>because he says that his wife visits him every day despite her being dead, and the person he&rsquo;s talking to supposedly died 37 years ago so</li></ul></li><li><a href=#on-monday-of-last-week><h2 id=on-monday-of-last-week><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>on monday of last week</h2></a></li><li>jumping monkey hill<ul><li>how during the process of writer&rsquo;s workshop, ujunwa writes something about her own life</li><li>the workshop is seen as a very &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; place</li><li>at the end, everyone else in the story says &ldquo;wowwww so unrealistic&rdquo; and she goes &ldquo;Bitch this was my monday morning&rdquo;</li></ul></li><li>the thing around your neck<ul><li>someone won american visa lottery yayyyy her name is akunna</li><li>so she&rsquo;s taken in by her &ldquo;uncle&rdquo; but he sexually assaults her</li><li>and now she&rsquo;s gone to get a job</li><li>later she meets a white guy who knows about african culture butttt it&rsquo;s more of a white guy romanticising thing</li><li>but he pays attention to her</li><li>so she dates him</li><li>thing around your neck is like the suffocating feeling she has</li><li>her dad dies and she leaves him (or does she!!!!1!!!1!!1)</li></ul></li><li>the american embassy<ul><li>story about someone&mldr;waiting in front of the american embassy&mldr;.for an asylum visa</li><li>her husband is a career-focused &ldquo;selfish&rdquo; (according to mc) news journalist who got smuggled over the border</li><li>when officials come to find him they end up shooting her son bcs they were drunk</li><li>so now she&rsquo;s seeking asylum</li><li>when she&rsquo;s applying she ends up walking out of the office??@? idk whyyyyy possibly because she wants to stay in nigeria for her culture, &ldquo;refusing to give herself up to america&rdquo; (from panel)</li></ul></li><li>the shivering<ul><li>ukamaka is a nigerian woman in college, worrying over a major plane crash in nigeria, as she believes that her ex, udenna, might have been aboard it</li><li>chinedu makes himself known as a fellow nigerian in her apartment suite and asks if they can pray together, ukamaka later telling him that she‚Äôs worried because her ex might have been on the flight. fortunately, through a call, she finds that he had missed his flight and is safe.</li><li>their friendship develops, driven mostly by ukamaka ‚Äúneed to rant‚Äù about her ex to chinedu</li><li>they discuss from the beginning to the end of the text about faith, specifically towards god - ukamaka is catholic and chinedu is pentecostal, though it seems his faith is a lot stronger than hers chinedu is an ambiguous character- unknown at first but slowly he reveals more about himself</li><li>once ukamaka relates chinedu‚Äôs struggles with love to her own, mentioning udenna once again, he snaps somewhat, and she tells him to get out of her apartment.</li><li>for a week they cut contact with each other</li><li>ukamaka knocks on chinedu‚Äôs door to apologise</li><li>incapable of finding the words, ukamaka instead asks if chinedu is working on a dissertation, to which he replies that he is busy before closing the door on her face</li><li>they go another week without contact until the following sunday when ukamaka showed up at chinedu‚Äôs door and apologised</li><li>chinedu opens up to ukamaka and tells her that is he at risk of deportation since his visa expired three years ago</li><li>ukamaka shows puzzle which grows into admiration for chinendu‚Äôs faith</li><li>they go to mass together the enddddd</li></ul></li><li>the arrangers of marriage</li><li>tomorrow is too far<ul><li>INCEST</li><li>they kill brother!!</li><li>sheeeeeeesh</li><li>it&rsquo;s giving first born son with privileges vs second born daughter who hates him</li><li><strong>panel notes:</strong><ul><li>portrays thin line between hatred and love</li><li>also an irony of the patriarchy; grandma although a woman is so headstrong on the idea of the first born son being more important</li><li>&ldquo;love can bloom from a shared hatred&rdquo;</li><li>told in second person - almost uncomfortable, and from a western perspective it can feel weird to &ldquo;be&rdquo; the one falling in love with a cousin</li><li>kind of keeps you in the dark about other perspectives, especially from the brother&rsquo;s feelings. maybe he felt resentment for their grandma, maybe he didn&rsquo;t care, we don&rsquo;t know</li><li>we wonder why the grandma is the &ldquo;head&rdquo; of the family, considering she is such a strong advocate for the patriarchy despite being a woman herself. we also know that her sons and husbands are notably absent from the story, perhaps that has influenced her need for a male heir to the family</li><li>love between mc and cousin might have been born out of hatred but turned into something more?</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>the headstrong historian<ul><li>mother sends son to catholic school in hopes of helping him learn english to have an advantage/protection which kind of made him distanced from his culture</li><li>and this his daughter, grace (take note of the christian name), realised she didn&rsquo;t have as much culture as she thought she did</li><li>she <em>is</em> the headstrong historian woah</li><li>as grandma was close to death the son begged her to be baptised because he didn&rsquo;t want to partake in a &ldquo;heathen&rdquo; ceremony oww</li><li><strong>panel notes:</strong><ul><li>close third person perspective but through the grandma, rather than grace</li><li>grandma&rsquo;s intent was just to have some sort of protection with speaking english, whereas he took it &ldquo;too far&rdquo; and became a son she didn&rsquo;t know - when asked about her name, her son said an anglo name rather than her real name</li><li>grandmother&rsquo;s journey with accepting her son&rsquo;s change is similar to five stages of grief; denial and then acceptance etc, slow change but change nonetheless</li><li>grandma was hoping that her son was her husband&rsquo;s soul reborn (again, the denial) to feel safe, and then when grace was born she realised that her &ldquo;husband was back&rdquo; through grace; she didn&rsquo;t anticipate this as much as she anticipated it for her son because of gender difference</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li><a href=/stalactite/notes/eng/language-and-literature/ data-ctx="the thing around your neck notes" data-src=/notes/eng/language-and-literature class=internal-link>language and literature</a></li></ul></div><div><script async src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://axeolotl69.github.io/stalactite/js/graph.6421b50adba269f8b1f5b3e0dc679564.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by will smith using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, ¬© 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://axeolotl69.github.io/stalactite>Home</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
