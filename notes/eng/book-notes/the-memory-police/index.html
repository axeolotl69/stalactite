you can still use them?? it’s like they’re paralysed but at least paralysed legs still hold meaning, but these don’t?? they’re like meaningless dangly things wtf</li><li>it also means that ppl couldn’t hide if they remembered left legs, because it’s hard to fake a limp and stuff. which makes me wonder whether whoever the memory police are actually did this on purpose</li><li>new communication with R’s wife: let the phone ring three times, three times back if R is doing well</li><li>mc continues writing</li><li>she feels sad about old man’s death, scared of losing her memories of him</li><li>now right arms are disappeared! people not as scared because a limb has disappeared once before already…this terrifies me further because they’re already so desensitised to things disappearing even something so crucial to every day life</li><li>something that i find interesting is this: mc says that she’ll soon be no longer able to get down to his room, because of limbs disappearing, and R says that it’s okay because he’ll carry her like a princess. but then she says “how can you hold something that’s not there?” and it means that she truly cannot fathom the idea of her limbs anymore. like even if they are right in front of her, they’re not <strong><strong><strong>there.</strong></strong></strong> and that is, once again, terrifying</li><li>she describes each disappeared thing as illusions—her limbs aren’t really hers, they’re just shells</li></ul></li><li><strong>chapter 27</strong><ul><li>in mc’s story again</li><li>girl hears someone else coming up, but she doesn’t ask for help. why? because she’s dependent on the guy already, she’s scared of going outside</li><li>and he knows that and uses that to his advantage, as he tries to steal another girl’s voice</li><li>he brings someone else up the tower—the girl—and now the protagonist is saying “this is the final moment” but i have no clue what that means</li></ul></li><li><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>chapter 28</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong><ul><li>i’m very surprised mc managed to write all of that, considering she’s now left handed and novels are disappeared</li><li>“it’s fortunate that old man died before body parts were disappeared because i can still remember the feeling of his hand in mine” what if i sob</li><li>more body parts are disappeared, some people are glad about fewer parts to manage…</li><li>mc is worried about where her tears would go if cheeks disappeared LORD</li><li>“the citizens of the island had lost everything that had a form, and our voices alone drifted endlessly.”</li><li>everyone disappears.
