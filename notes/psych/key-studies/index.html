<strong>aim:</strong> to investigate the role of the hippocampus in learning/memory in London male taxi drivers
<strong>procedure:</strong></p><ul><li>quasi experiment</li><li>sample: 16 London taxi drivers (male and right-handed) and 50 non-taxi drivers (also male and right-handed)<ul><li>taxi drivers had years of training and experience which developed their spacial recognition/awareness</li></ul></li><li>IV - taxi driver/non-taxi driver</li><li>DV - volume of hippocampus, including their anterior, body, and posterior regions; measured by analysing MRI scans of participant&rsquo;s brains, analysed through pixel counting and VBM
<strong>findings:</strong></li><li>taxi drivers had greater grey matter density in the <u>posterior hippocampus</u> compared to the control group</li><li>positive correlation between amount of time as a taxi driver and greater volume of right posterior hippocampus (r=0.6)</li><li>negative correlation between amount of time as a taxi driver and anterior hippocampal volume
<strong>conclusions:</strong></li><li>there are regionally specific structural differences between the hippocampi of licensed taxi drivers compared to those who are not taxi drivers</li><li>professional dependence on navigational skills in licensed London taxi drivers is associated with a relative redistribution of grey matter in the hippocampus</li><li>findings also indicate the possibility of local plasticity in the structure of a normal human brain which allows it to adapt in response to prolonged environmental stimuli
<strong>strengths:</strong></li><li>single blind; researcher did not know whether MRI scans belonged to taxi driver or non-taxi driver. avoids researcher bias</li><li>ethically sound
<strong>weaknesses:</strong></li><li>quasi experiment; only correlational findings</li><li>sampling bias due to male population, difficult to generalise results</li></ul><a href=#hm-milner-1966><h2 id=hm-milner-1966><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>HM: MILNER 1966</h2></a><p>#rmofcognitiveapproach #localisationoffunction #multistoremodelofmemory #biologicalapproach #cognitiveapproach
<strong>aim:</strong> to better understand the effects that the surgery had on HM
<strong>procedure:</strong></p><ul><li>longitudinal case study, HM had a surgery which removed tissue from medial temporal lobe (including hippocampus)</li><li>used various different strategies, using method triangulation<ul><li>psychometric testing; his IQ was above average</li><li>direct observation of his behaviour</li><li>interviews with HM and his family members</li><li>cognitive tests; memory tests and learning tasks</li><li>MRI to determine the extent of damage done
<strong>findings:</strong></li></ul></li><li>HM could not acquire episodic or semantic knowledge; memory about events and information about world around him respectively</li><li>he was however able to draw a picture of his house; cognitive knowledge</li><li>had capacity for working memory; was asked to remember the number 584 and could repeat it 15 minutes after, though once the task was over HM couldn&rsquo;t remember it</li><li>he knew how to mow a lawn (procedural memory)
<strong>conclusions:</strong></li><li>suggests that surgery removed brain structures which contributed to moving memories from short-term to long-term</li><li>he could draw a photo of his house, suggesting that cognitive memory is not encoded in the same way as semantic or episodic</li><li>suggests short-term memory is not stored in hippocampus</li><li>suggests that medial temporal lobe is not site of permanent storage, but organises and stores elsewhere in the brain
<strong>strengths:</strong></li><li>longitudinal+method triangulation</li><li>ecological validity - less extraneous variables</li><li>very ethically sound
<strong>weaknesses:</strong></li><li>cannot easily be replicated</li><li>retrospective; we did not know much about HM before the incident</li><li>hard to generalise</li></ul><a href=#dragniski-et-al-2004-juggling><h2 id=dragniski-et-al-2004-juggling><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>DRAGNISKI et al 2004, juggling</h2></a><p>#neuroplasticity #neuralpruning #synapses #biologicalapproach
<strong>aim:</strong> to see whether learning a new skill (juggling in this case) would have an effect on the brains of the participants
<strong>procedure:</strong></p><ul><li>type of study: experimental</li><li>24 volunteers between ages 20-24; 21 females and 3 males, all non-jugglers at the start of the study</li><li>everyone had an MRI scan at the start of the study, then the sample was separated into two groups: jugglers and non-jugglers</li><li>jugglers were taught how to juggle, then asked to practice. when they had mastered it they would contact the researchers and have another MRI scan</li><li>non-juggling group was the control</li><li>three months after that, another MRI scan was taken
<strong>findings:</strong></li><li>MRIs analysed using VBM</li><li>after they had mastered juggling, jugglers had significantly larger amounts of grey matter in the mid-temporal lobe in both hemispheres (associated with visual memory)</li><li>the final MRI showed that this grey matter had decreased
<strong>conclusions:</strong></li><li>suggests that learning a new skill changes the grey matter density in the respective part of the brain, supporting neuroplasticity</li><li>and that as skills are less used, neural pruning occurs.</li><li>juggling relies more on visual memory than spatial??
<strong>strengths:</strong></li><li></li><li>small sample size</li><li>internal validity issues; participants were at home for most of the experiment, many extraneous variables</li></ul><a href=#crockett-et-al-2010-trolley-dilemma><h2 id=crockett-et-al-2010-trolley-dilemma><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CROCKETT et al 2010, trolley dilemma</h2></a><p>#neurotransmission #agonist #biologicalapproach
<strong>aim:</strong> to see whether citalopram, an SSRI, affects pro-social behaviour
<strong>procedure:</strong></p><ul><li>repeated measures experimental design</li><li>sample: 30 healthy subjects, mean age was 26</li><li>experimental group: participants given a does of citalopram (which blocks reuptake of serotonin from the synapse+boosts concentration)</li><li>control group: was given a placebo</li><li>research was double-blind study</li><li>after taking the drug, participants were given a series of moral dilemmas that involved impersonal situations like the trolley problem (saving five people and killing one, or vice versa) or personal situations (pushing a man off a bridge to stop a train from killing five people)
<strong>findings:</strong></li><li>responses in the impersonal version were unaffected by citalopram</li><li>after one dose of citalopram, participants were less likely to push the man off the bridge in the personal scenario, than participants in the placebo condition
<strong>conclusions:</strong></li><li>serotonin reduces acceptability of personal harm, and in this way promotes prosocial behaviour</li><li>serotonin modulates reactions of the brain to emotinoally salient situations so that inflicting harm on other people is judged as less acceptable
<strong>strengths:</strong>
<strong>weaknesses:</strong> authors recognised that citalopram intake induced slight nausea, which could mean that participants could work out whether they were in the experimental on control group</li></ul><a href=#fisher-aron--brown-2005><h2 id=fisher-aron--brown-2005><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>FISHER, ARON & BROWN 2005</h2></a><p>#neurotransmission #biologicalapproach
<strong>aim:</strong> to find how dopamine affects being in love (?)
<strong>procedure:</strong></p><ul><li>sample: 10 men and 7 women who were currently &ldquo;intensely in love&rdquo; but not with each other, recruited by volunteering. mean age was 21 and mean duration of being in love was 7 months</li><li>all participants went under an fMRI and engaged in a standardised procedure of looking at photos while their brains were scanned. there were four stages:<ul><li>for 30 seconds, each participant viewed a photo of their loved one</li><li>40 second filler activity which was to count back from a given number</li><li>30 more seconds participants viewed a pot of an emotionally neutral acquaintance</li><li>final stage was 20 seconds of counting back from a given number</li></ul></li><li>these steps were repeated 6 times, so the total procedure lasted 720 seconds (12 minutes)
<strong>findings:</strong></li><li>specific pattern of activation in the brains of participants in response to the photographs of their loved ones; activation was observed in dopamine-rich neural systems, primarily the VTA and caudate nucleus</li><li>both VTA and caudate nucleus are rich in dopamine and form the key part of the so-called copaminergic pathway - a system that generates and transmits dopamine, and increases dopamine activity in the brain</li><li>reward system, dopaminergic activity is associated with motivation and feelings of pleasure (romantic love??)
<strong>conclusions:</strong></li><li>inferred that dopamine plays a role in love

<strong>procedure:</strong></p><ul><li>86 heterosexual men, some of which were single and some were in a stable monogomous relationship</li><li>double-blind independent measures design</li><li><u>task one:</u> subjects positions at the end of a room while an &ldquo;attractive&rdquo; female experimenter was positioned on the other side. subject was required to move slowly towards the female experimenter and stop at a distance that made him feel slightly uncomfortable/too close</li><li><u>task two:</u> subjects viewed a series of pictures on a screen 50cm away from them, each picture was shown for 2secs each. four kinds of pictures were shown: positive social, negative social, positive non-social, and negative non-social. all participants had a joystick, and if they liked the picture they were asked to pull the joystick which resulted in an increase of the pictures size/vice versa with disliked images (simulation of approach or avoidance)</li><li>IV - oxytocin/placebo intranasally administered</li><li>DV - how far men stood away from female researcher/how close or far the images were placed
<strong>findings:</strong></li><li><u>task one:</u> non-single males with oxytocin dose stood further away from women (avg of 71cm) while single males on oxytocin dose were barely affected</li><li><u>task two:</u> only groups of pictures affected by oxytocin and relationship status was the positive social group (attractive women pics); specifically, participants in a relationship who had oxytocin had slower reaction time in response to pictures
<strong>conclusions:</strong></li><li>oxytocin caused men in a relationship to &ldquo;stay away from&rdquo; an attractive woman who was not his partner</li><li>oxytocin selectively inhibits approach to certain stimuli (attractive women) in men who are in a stable relationship, but not in single men</li><li>oxytocin plays a role in fidelity
<strong>strengths:</strong></li><li>double blind, indepdendent measures

<strong>aim:</strong> to investigate the effect of oxytocin on inter-group conflict and out-group conflicts
<strong>procedure:</strong></p><ul><li>double-blind experiment</li><li>independent measures design</li><li>sample of 102 males</li><li>self administed a dose of oxytocin or a placebo through nasal spray</li><li>participants were randomly assigned to 3 person groups and told they would need to compete against another group of 3</li><li>each person was paired with a member of another 3 person group, and they played a modified version of &ldquo;prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma&rdquo; (that one game between cooperating/not cooperating and you gain/lose points)</li><li>payoffs from the game was converted to real money and given to the participants
<strong>findings:</strong></li><li>a player&rsquo;s defence-motivated non-cooperation<ul><li>is more likely if vulnerability of the player&rsquo;s group is high</li><li>does not depend so much on the player&rsquo;s own vulnerability</li><li>is more likely in the oxytocin condition
<strong>conclusions:</strong></li></ul></li><li>oxytocin-induced non-cooperation is motivated by the desire to protect vulnerable group members, and not so much the desire to protect oneself</li><li>reinforces the role of oxytocin in creation bonds with members of your ingroup</li><li>shows that oxytocin can have a reverse, negative side in creating defensiveness and non-cooperation with others

<strong>aim:</strong> to test whether a female will rate a sweaty t-shirt as more attractive if it is from a man with different immune system genes to her own
<strong>procedure:</strong></p><ul><li>49 females and 44 males tested for immune system genes</li><li>males asked to wear a plain white t-shirt for 2 days</li><li>t-shirts then put in closed boxes until females were asked to smell them</li><li>females asked to rate the t-shirts for pleasantness and sexiness
<strong>findings:</strong></li><li>women rated the t-shirts as more pleasant and sexy if they came from a man with different MHC genes
<strong>conclusions:</strong></li><li>people are more motivated to find a mate with different immune system genes so their offspring will have stronger immune systems</li><li>also concluded body odour, not pheromones, is an important element of sociosexual behaviour
<strong>strengths:</strong></li><li>has been successfully replicated</li><li>double blind experiment</li><li>met ethical standards</li><li>well controlled; ensured that it was the odor being smelt and nothing else</li><li>ecologically valid(?)
<strong>weaknesses:</strong></li><li></li><li>sample was four groups of healthy non-smokers, including 24 hetero males, 24 hetero females, 24 homo males and 24 bi/homo females</li><li>participants watched stick figures walking on a screen and were asked to guess the gender of the stick figure</li><li>while watching, participants were exposed to the smell of cloves. in experimental condition, the cloves were mixed with AND; in control only cloves were used
<strong>findings:</strong></li><li>when het females and homo men were exposed to AND they had a higher rate of identifying the stick figure as &ldquo;masculine&rdquo; than the control group</li><li>AND had no significant effect on het men or homo women
<strong>conclusions:</strong></li><li>AND and EST may have some effect on human sexual behaviour
<strong>strengths:</strong></li><li>highly standardised procedure, easy to replicate</li><li>sample allowed for differences in sexuality</li><li>all participants were exposed to female version of AND, which was EST, and similar results were explained for het males but not as strongly for homo females</li><li>counter-balanced to control order effects

<strong>aim:</strong> to test three evolution-based assumptions about human mate selection:</p><ol><li>as men are searching for women with high reproductive value, they will favour youth and physical appearance</li><li>as woman are searching for men who will invest in their offspring, they will favour a man with the resources he can provide</li><li>as men do not want to invest in another man&rsquo;s child, abstinence will be highly valued
<strong>procedure:</strong></li></ol><ul><li>37 samples taken from 33 countries, total of 10k participants</li><li>each sample completed two surveys; the first collected biographical data asking participants what age they prefer to marry at, their preferred age difference between themselves and their spouse, who should be older in a couple and how many children they want</li><li>they then rated 18 characteristics on a 4-point scale on how important they think they are</li><li>second survey provided 13 characteristics that participants were asked to rank in terms of desirability in a mate
<strong>findings:</strong></li><li>in 36/37 samples, women valued &ldquo;good financial prospects&rdquo; in a potential mate more than males did</li><li>in all samples, men preferred mates who are younger, with an average age of 24.83 (close to the peak female fertility age)</li><li>34/37 samples showed that males value physical attractiveness in potential mates more than females do</li><li>only 23/37 samples valued chastity

<strong>aim:</strong> to investigate whether the interval of time between words on a list would increase number of words recalled at the start of the list. (eg primacy vs recency)
<strong>procedure:</strong></p><ul><li>sample: 240 army enlisted men</li><li>independent samples design</li><li>40 men allocated to each condition:<ul><li>words read once at 3sec rate</li><li>words read twice at 3sec rate</li><li>words read once at 6sec rate</li><li>words read twice at 6sec rate</li><li>words read once at 9sec rate</li><li>words read twice at 9sec rate</li></ul></li><li>participants first given two 5-word practice lists so they could learn the procedure</li><li>listened to recordings of eight 20-word lists, lists were the same for each group</li><li>all words common one-syllable words</li><li>participants had two minutes to write down the words they recalled in any order
<strong>findings:</strong></li><li>increased time interval between words led to an increase in the recall of all words in the list except for those at the end</li><li>effect of repetition on recall was limited to 3sec rate</li><li>no significant effect on recall in the 6 or 9sec rates
<strong>conclusions:</strong></li><li>primacy is the result of rehearsal</li><li>increased time interval allowed for more rehearsal, thus greater overall recall of the list of words</li><li>however, words in the STM were still available in working memory, no significant change in frequency of recall</li><li>words at end of the list are not rehearsed as often and thus decay from STM</li><li>supports idea that LTM and STM are separate stores
