<strong>aim:</strong> to investigate the role of the hippocampus in learning/memory in London male taxi drivers
<strong>procedure:</strong></p><ul><li>quasi experiment</li><li>sample: 16 London taxi drivers (male and right-handed) and 50 non-taxi drivers (also male and right-handed)<ul><li>taxi drivers had years of training and experience which developed their spacial recognition/awareness</li></ul></li><li>IV - taxi driver/non-taxi driver</li><li>DV - volume of hippocampus, including their anterior, body, and posterior regions; measured by analysing MRI scans of participant&rsquo;s brains, analysed through pixel counting and VBM
<strong>findings:</strong></li><li>taxi drivers had greater grey matter density in the <u>posterior hippocampus</u> compared to the control group</li><li>positive correlation between amount of time as a taxi driver and greater volume of right posterior hippocampus (r=0.6)</li><li>negative correlation between amount of time as a taxi driver and anterior hippocampal volume
<strong>conclusions:</strong></li><li>there are regionally specific structural differences between the hippocampi of licensed taxi drivers compared to those who are not taxi drivers</li><li>professional dependence on navigational skills in licensed London taxi drivers is associated with a relative redistribution of grey matter in the hippocampus</li><li>findings also indicate the possibility of local plasticity in the structure of a normal human brain which allows it to adapt in response to prolonged environmental stimuli
<strong>strengths:</strong></li><li>single blind; researcher did not know whether MRI scans belonged to taxi driver or non-taxi driver. avoids researcher bias</li><li>ethically sound
<strong>weaknesses:</strong></li><li>quasi experiment; only correlational findings</li><li>sampling bias due to male population, difficult to generalise results</li></ul><a href=#hm-milner-1966><h2 id=hm-milner-1966><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>HM: MILNER 1966</h2></a><p>#rmofcognitiveapproach #localisationoffunction #multistoremodelofmemory #biologicalapproach #cognitiveapproach #techniquestostudythebrain
<strong>aim:</strong> to better understand the effects that the surgery had on HM
<strong>procedure:</strong></p><ul><li>longitudinal case study, HM had a surgery which removed tissue from medial temporal lobe (including hippocampus)</li><li>used various different strategies, using method triangulation<ul><li>psychometric testing; his IQ was above average</li><li>direct observation of his behaviour</li><li>interviews with HM and his family members</li><li>cognitive tests; memory tests and learning tasks</li><li>MRI to determine the extent of damage done
<strong>findings:</strong></li></ul></li><li>HM could not acquire episodic or semantic knowledge; memory about events and information about world around him respectively</li><li>he was however able to draw a picture of his house; cognitive knowledge</li><li>had capacity for working memory; was asked to remember the number 584 and could repeat it 15 minutes after, though once the task was over HM couldn&rsquo;t remember it</li><li>he knew how to mow a lawn (procedural memory)
<strong>conclusions:</strong></li><li>suggests that surgery removed brain structures which contributed to moving memories from short-term to long-term</li><li>he could draw a photo of his house, suggesting that cognitive memory is not encoded in the same way as semantic or episodic</li><li>suggests short-term memory is not stored in hippocampus</li><li>suggests that medial temporal lobe is not site of permanent storage, but organises and stores elsewhere in the brain
<strong>strengths:</strong></li><li>longitudinal+method triangulation</li><li>ecological validity - less extraneous variables</li><li>very ethically sound
<strong>weaknesses:</strong></li><li>cannot easily be replicated</li><li>retrospective; we did not know much about HM before the incident</li><li>hard to generalise</li></ul><a href=#dragniski-et-al-2004-juggling><h2 id=dragniski-et-al-2004-juggling><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>DRAGNISKI et al 2004, juggling</h2></a><p>#neuroplasticity #neuralpruning #synapses #biologicalapproach #techniquestostudythebrain
<strong>aim:</strong> to see whether learning a new skill (juggling in this case) would have an effect on the brains of the participants
<strong>procedure:</strong></p><ul><li>type of study: experimental</li><li>24 volunteers between ages 20-24; 21 females and 3 males, all non-jugglers at the start of the study</li><li>everyone had an MRI scan at the start of the study, then the sample was separated into two groups: jugglers and non-jugglers</li><li>jugglers were taught how to juggle, then asked to practice. when they had mastered it they would contact the researchers and have another MRI scan</li><li>non-juggling group was the control</li><li>three months after that, another MRI scan was taken
<strong>findings:</strong></li><li>MRIs analysed using VBM</li><li>after they had mastered juggling, jugglers had significantly larger amounts of grey matter in the mid-temporal lobe in both hemispheres (associated with visual memory)</li><li>the final MRI showed that this grey matter had decreased
<strong>conclusions:</strong></li><li>suggests that learning a new skill changes the grey matter density in the respective part of the brain, supporting neuroplasticity</li><li>and that as skills are less used, neural pruning occurs.</li><li>juggling relies more on visual memory than spatial??
<strong>strengths:</strong></li><li></li><li>small sample size</li><li>internal validity issues; participants were at home for most of the experiment, many extraneous variables</li></ul><a href=#crockett-et-al-2010-trolley-dilemma><h2 id=crockett-et-al-2010-trolley-dilemma><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>CROCKETT et al 2010, trolley dilemma</h2></a><p>#neurotransmission #agonist #biologicalapproach
<strong>aim:</strong> to see whether citalopram, an SSRI, affects pro-social behaviour

<strong>findings:</strong></li><li>responses in the impersonal version were unaffected by citalopram</li><li>after one dose of citalopram, participants were less likely to push the man off the bridge in the personal scenario, than participants in the placebo condition

<strong>procedure:</strong></p><ul><li>sample: 24 participants, all were in nyc on the day of 9/11</li><li>recruited through advertisements</li><li>put into an fMRI</li><li>while in the scanner, presented with words on a screen - &ldquo;summer&rdquo; and &ldquo;september&rdquo; were included in order to have participants link the words to the events of 9/11</li><li>brain activity observed as they recalled the event</li><li>participants then asked to rate their memories for vividness, detail, confidence in accuracy, and arousal</li><li>also asked to write a description of the memories
<strong>findings:</strong></li><li>half of the participants reported having a &ldquo;flashbulb memory&rdquo;, and those who did reported that they were closer to the world trade centre - they also provided more specific details</li><li>activation of amygdala for those closer to the event was higher recalling the events of 9/11 than the event of the preceding summer, whereas those further away from the event had similar activation of the amygdala between the two events
<strong>conclusions:</strong></li><li>close personal experience may be critical in the process of creating flashbulb memories

<strong>aim:</strong> to determine whether flashbulb memories are susceptible to distortion.
<strong>procedure:</strong></p><ul><li>sample: 106 -> 44 university psychology students</li><li>taking place the morning after the Challenger disaster, they were given a questionnaire on the events, asking questions such as &ldquo;where were you&rdquo; and &ldquo;how did you hear about it&rdquo;</li><li>2 and 1/2 years later, they were given the same questionnaire, and then also asked about how accurate they thought their memory was (1-5)</li><li>then a few months later, an interview was held
<strong>findings:</strong></li><li>after comparing the initial responses to the questionnaire to the one completed 2 1/2 years later, it was found that out of the 7 &ldquo;content&rdquo; questions, there was a large discrepancy amongst most participants - only 3 had their questionnaires completely match up
<strong>conclusions:</strong></li><li>suggests that flashbulb memories aren&rsquo;t as reliable as they can still be manipulated after
