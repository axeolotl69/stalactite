<strong>aim:</strong> to investigate the role of the hippocampus in learning/memory in London male taxi drivers
<strong>procedure:</strong></p><ul><li>quasi experiment</li><li>sample: 16 London taxi drivers (male and right-handed) and 50 non-taxi drivers (also male and right-handed)<ul><li>taxi drivers had years of training and experience which developed their spacial recognition/awareness</li></ul></li><li>IV - taxi driver/non-taxi driver</li><li>DV - volume of hippocampus, including their anterior, body, and posterior regions; measured by analysing MRI scans of participant&rsquo;s brains, analysed through pixel counting and VBM
<strong>findings:</strong></li><li>taxi drivers had greater grey matter density in the <u>posterior hippocampus</u> compared to the control group</li><li>positive correlation between amount of time as a taxi driver and greater volume of right posterior hippocampus (r=0.6)</li><li>negative correlation between amount of time as a taxi driver and anterior hippocampal volume
<strong>conclusions:</strong></li><li>there are regionally specific structural differences between the hippocampi of licensed taxi drivers compared to those who are not taxi drivers</li><li>professional dependence on navigational skills in licensed London taxi drivers is associated with a relative redistribution of grey matter in the hippocampus</li><li>findings also indicate the possibility of local plasticity in the structure of a normal human brain which allows it to adapt in response to prolonged environmental stimuli
<strong>strengths:</strong></li><li>single blind; researcher did not know whether MRI scans belonged to taxi driver or non-taxi driver. avoids researcher bias</li><li>ethically sound
<strong>weaknesses:</strong></li><li>quasi experiment; only correlational findings</li><li>sampling bias due to male population, difficult to generalise results</li></ul><a href=#hm-milner-1966-bicycle-boy><h2 id=hm-milner-1966-bicycle-boy><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>HM: MILNER 1966, bicycle boy</h2></a><p>#rmofcognitiveapproach #localisationoffunction #multistoremodelofmemory #biologicalapproach #cognitiveapproach #techniquestostudythebrain
<strong>aim:</strong> to better understand the effects that the surgery had on HM
<strong>procedure:</strong></p><ul><li>longitudinal case study, HM had a surgery which removed tissue from medial temporal lobe (including hippocampus)</li><li>used various different strategies, using method triangulation<ul><li>psychometric testing; his IQ was above average</li><li>direct observation of his behaviour</li><li>interviews with HM and his family members</li><li>cognitive tests; memory tests and learning tasks</li><li>MRI to determine the extent of damage done
<strong>findings:</strong></li></ul></li><li>HM could not acquire episodic or semantic knowledge; memory about events and information about world around him respectively</li><li>he was however able to draw a picture of his house; cognitive knowledge</li><li>had capacity for working memory; was asked to remember the number 584 and could repeat it 15 minutes after, though once the task was over HM couldn&rsquo;t remember it</li><li>he knew how to mow a lawn (procedural memory)
<strong>conclusions:</strong></li><li>suggests that surgery removed brain structures which contributed to moving memories from short-term to long-term</li><li>he could draw a photo of his house, suggesting that cognitive memory is not encoded in the same way as semantic or episodic</li><li>suggests short-term memory is not stored in hippocampus</li><li>suggests that medial temporal lobe is not site of permanent storage, but organises and stores elsewhere in the brain
<strong>strengths:</strong></li><li>longitudinal+method triangulation</li><li>ecological validity - less extraneous variables</li><li>very ethically sound

<strong>procedure:</strong></p><ul><li>type of study: experimental</li><li>24 volunteers between ages 20-24; 21 females and 3 males, all non-jugglers at the start of the study</li><li>everyone had an MRI scan at the start of the study, then the sample was separated into two groups: jugglers and non-jugglers</li><li>jugglers were taught how to juggle, then asked to practice. when they had mastered it they would contact the researchers and have another MRI scan</li><li>non-juggling group was the control</li><li>three months after that, another MRI scan was taken
<strong>findings:</strong></li><li>MRIs analysed using VBM</li><li>after they had mastered juggling, jugglers had significantly larger amounts of grey matter in the mid-temporal lobe in both hemispheres (associated with visual memory)</li><li>the final MRI showed that this grey matter had decreased
<strong>conclusions:</strong></li><li>suggests that learning a new skill changes the grey matter density in the respective part of the brain, supporting neuroplasticity</li><li>and that as skills are less used, neural pruning occurs.</li><li>juggling relies more on visual memory than spatial??

<strong>aim:</strong> to see whether citalopram, an SSRI, affects pro-social behaviour
<strong>procedure:</strong></p><ul><li>repeated measures experimental design</li><li>sample: 30 healthy subjects, mean age was 26</li><li>experimental group: participants given a does of citalopram (which blocks reuptake of serotonin from the synapse+boosts concentration)</li><li>control group: was given a placebo</li><li>research was double-blind study</li><li>after taking the drug, participants were given a series of moral dilemmas that involved impersonal situations like the trolley problem (saving five people and killing one, or vice versa) or personal situations (pushing a man off a bridge to stop a train from killing five people)
<strong>findings:</strong></li><li>responses in the impersonal version were unaffected by citalopram</li><li>after one dose of citalopram, participants were less likely to push the man off the bridge in the personal scenario, than participants in the placebo condition
<strong>conclusions:</strong></li><li>serotonin reduces acceptability of personal harm, and in this way promotes prosocial behaviour</li><li>serotonin modulates reactions of the brain to emotinoally salient situations so that inflicting harm on other people is judged as less acceptable

<strong>findings:</strong></li><li>specific pattern of activation in the brains of participants in response to the photographs of their loved ones; activation was observed in dopamine-rich neural systems, primarily the VTA and caudate nucleus</li><li>both VTA and caudate nucleus are rich in dopamine and form the key part of the so-called copaminergic pathway - a system that generates and transmits dopamine, and increases dopamine activity in the brain</li><li>reward system, dopaminergic activity is associated with motivation and feelings of pleasure (romantic love??)

<strong>findings:</strong></li><li><u>task one:</u> non-single males with oxytocin dose stood further away from women (avg of 71cm) while single males on oxytocin dose were barely affected</li><li><u>task two:</u> only groups of pictures affected by oxytocin and relationship status was the positive social group (attractive women pics); specifically, participants in a relationship who had oxytocin had slower reaction time in response to pictures
<strong>conclusions:</strong></li><li>oxytocin caused men in a relationship to &ldquo;stay away from&rdquo; an attractive woman who was not his partner</li><li>oxytocin selectively inhibits approach to certain stimuli (attractive women) in men who are in a stable relationship, but not in single men</li><li>oxytocin plays a role in fidelity

<strong>procedure:</strong></p><ul><li>274 adults from five countries:<ul><li>china</li><li>usa</li><li>uk</li><li>turkey</li><li>germany</li></ul></li><li>participants given five minutes to recall as many memories as possible of public events during their lifetime</li><li>then they were asked questions about those events, such as &ldquo;where were you when you learned of the event&rdquo; and &ldquo;who were you with&rdquo;</li><li>then they were asked questions about the importance of the event to them personally, such as &ldquo;how personally important was the event&rdquo;
<strong>findings:</strong></li><li>in collectivist cultures such as china, personal relevance and importance played less of a role in the formation of flashbulb memories compared to individualist cultures
<strong>conclusions:</strong></li><li>in individualist cultures, there is more emphasis on the individual&rsquo;s experiences, so the more important and relevant an event is to the individual the more likely a flashbulb memory will form</li><li>in collectivist cultures, there is less emphasis on the individual&rsquo;s experiences and more emphasis on the group&rsquo;s; thus, individual relevance and importance is not as important in the development of a flashbulb memory
<strong>strengths:</strong></li><li>the test and the questionnaire was given in the native language of the participants (controlled variables)</li><li>utilised back-translation to ensure the translations were accurate; increases credibility of the study
