  introduced to setting…somewhat\n    -   two seperate povs kind of: one of the “natives” and the “settlers”\n    -   we meet jacky, a native, who ran?? somewhere. absconded. he was taken away from his family but remembers them, remembers he had a family and a home\n    -   and some settlers who are determined to educate the souls of the natives “if they even had souls”\n    -   we know the settlers think of natives as almost sub-human\n-   chapter 2\n    -   jacky continues running, “absconding”\n    -   his only weapon is a kitchen knife he stole\n    -   he remembers a little as he keeps running\n-   chapter 3\n    -   introduced to head of the department of the protection of natives, aka “devil”\n        -   “i don’t need my real name anyways. names are for people to identify with. everyone already knows who i am.”\n    -   he denies every request the natives present…asshole\n    -   he hates the landscape here as he hates the natives, then choosing to replace his hate for the natives with pity, thinking of them as children who need to be saved\n    -   also introduced to esperance, a second gen native born in camp\n    -   she describes that everyone in their camp longs for a home they don’t have\n    -   she wishes to go home, but this camp is the closest thing she has to “home”, so she doesn’t want to leave\n-   chapter 4\n    -   introduced to sargeant rohan, apprehensive to finding jacky\n    -   he thinks that the natives should be grateful for living in these camps, rather than living “pointless, aimless lives in the dirt like they always had.”\n    -   he thinks their only ambitions are to drink, breed, and escape\n    -   he brings some men along with him to hunt and kill jacky; they all find some wicked pleasure in hunting natives like wild animals out of hate\n    -   jacky ran into a nun who told him where to go oh no he forgot his shoes\n-   chapter 5\n    -   we meet johnny star, a settler who ran away and meets tucker, a native\n    -   he assumes tucker doesn’t know english…he does\n    -   explores the idea of the stolen children, how it’s easier to manipulate them when taken younger\n-   chapter 6\n    -   rohan and his men continue searching for jacky (failing)\n-   chapter 7\n    -   explores more of johnny’s group; tucker and others, where johnny is their leader\n    -   explores how different johnny is from the natives around him; he doesn’t appreciate the food or the landscape, yet he still thinks the natives don’t deserve to be treated the way they are\n    -   jacky…continues running\n    -   someone stole some flour and rohan decides to blame it on jacky as an excuse\n-   chapter 8\n    -   sister bagra receives a letter from back home(?) that an investigator is being sent regarding claims that she’s mistreating the natives, along with the entire colony mistreating them\n    -   she Does Not like this, saying that “anyone that has trained animals would surely know that only a firm hand can teach them” and “even little children must be disciplined” once again dehumanising them\n    -   johnny is about to die of hunger BUT at least he has the power of friendship and doesn’t hate himself!!!\n-   chapter 9\n    -   jacky. is running.\n    -   johnny and his gang share stories the depressing kind\n    -   rohan asks “their” native for water. he finds water in a tree\n    -   “their” native runs away at night. go him!\n    -   ohhhh mel was the one who sent the letter about sister bagra\n    -   someone informs esperance that rohan went into their camp looking for water probably\n-   chapter 10\n    -   the quote at the start is supposedly written in 2041, so we know terra nullius is like a dystopia based on the past…\n-   chapter 11\n    -   bagra decided to discipline all of the children rather than the individuals involved, because “they all looked the same to her” verbatim\n        -   bcs of a few chapters ago (i forgot) where someone was hiding the fact that some natives ran away and they brought them back idk…\n    -   bagra is blaming this on jacky, for breaking in, because those she is “taking care” of also aspire to have a home, and the nuns are doubting whether the children can be or should be tamed\n    -   she strongly believes that the natives shouldn’t need to look for their other home because their home is right herre and she doesn’t understand why they want to look so badly\n    -   she sends a letter to “devil” to hurry up catching jacky because apparently that’ll solve all her problems\n-   chapter 12\n    -   johnny star is Dying of dehydration, his gang has left him and he doesn’t know why because he’s currently delirious (either they abandoned him or are finding water)\n    -   he mentioned how some troopers would rather kill themselves than die of dehydration, “dry death”, but he was too stubborn to do so—he believed, he hoped that water would come\n    -   he starts thinking of his “home”, where it wasn’t dry\n    -   he thinks of his childhood which he hated, for its intense structure and mental inflexibility\n        -   bcs he was disobedient\n        -   he was in fights often\n    -   he was almost brought to jail then, and now thinks that “jail would have been the easier fate”\n-   chapter 13\n    -   jacky is still trying to find jerramungup\n    -   he is Lost\n    -   he meets johnny who is literally gasping for water\n    -   he refers to him as Toad, as the natives refer to the settlers\n    -   jacky wonders whether his kindness to johnny is out of trained compassion for settlers, or out of his own humanity\n    -   johnny says thank you (a first for jacky, coming from a settler) and he resists calling him “master” as he is conditioned to\n    -   now he’s looking for water\n-   chapter 14\n    -   esperance hopes for her family, her mob, to “learn to sing in harmony like the magpies”\n    -   her plan is that if they were overrun by settlers, the last bullet in her gun was for herself….\n    -   esperance speaks of a woman, livia, who was so badly traumatised she screamed a lot, often not completely conscious\n    -   when she was conscious, her story was pieced together: she came from like a baby farm?? and they’d inject something so that all the women would give birth\n    -   the new gen of farmed babies (i personally have chosen to call them this) were a lot more robotic, than the older gen. still human, yes, but esperance describes how nothing they do is unnecessary, while the older gen are much more rebellious—human\n    -   and these new kids were all the same sickly white skin tone, like porcelain\n    -   esperance’s grandfather, after hearing this story, taught her how to use the gun (without bullets as they had none to spare)\n    -   esperance thinks the settlers value their livestock more than the natives (she’s probably right)\n    -   jacky approaches johnny again, except johnny’s gang is back. when he gets closer, the gang asks why jacky didn’t kill him, when johnny was so helpless, why jacky didn’t rid the world of a settler. jacky explains that it was ********because******** he was so helpless, that jacky couldn’t kill him. johnny thanks him once again, and jacky describes him as human\n-   chapter 15\n    -   esperance’s grandfather tells the story of his experience with the invasion—then apologises to esperance that her grandmother died giving birth to her mother, and now esperance is the only one he has left. he disappears into the bush before esperance has a chance to tell him it’s not his fault\n    -   bagra is (with an illegally downloaded program) looking through security cameras to try and find evidence that mel is up to no good. she is failing\n    -   because mel shows more kindness to the natives than the other nuns did, bagra was suspicious of her, yet she couldn’t find any evidence that she was the one who had sent in the complaint mail\n    -   she snoops around mel’s room, finds nothing, leaves\n    -   jacky keeps talking of jerramungup in like a dreamy tone and everyone around him is telling him to shut up (/lh) and goes “we just need a map” but he knows it’s Not That Simple\n    -   rohan learns from a native informant that johnny and jacky are working together now!! and that makes life harder for him since he believes johnny is able to hide them even more efficiently\n    -   some random settler farmer told rohan she saw the star gang and they robbed her but because they had guns she and her husband did nothing. and now her husband is going to try and (illegally) hunt natives. which means there is a legal way to do it. anyways rohan has no choice but to report it (he is kind of sad about this)\n    -   grark is being led through the breeding facility and is Disgusted, he wants to stop it but has to pretend that he is Not Disgusted\n    -   he writes the report but remembers that mail takes a long time to send back but he sends it anyways cuz what choice does he have\n    -   turns out he’s the investigator for bagra’s missionary\n-   chapter 16\n    -   johnny and gang have obtained map! yippee\n    -   it’s very futuristic; a holo. johnny explains how he got rid of paper 2d maps and gps from rebel humans…seems like everywhere is rlly strict in this dystopia\n    -   jacky asks why johnny isn’t “home”, johnny explains that he’d probably die if he was caught\n    -   they reach jerramungup…to find that jacky’s parents both died from the invasion…\n    -   jacky was originally named fred junior as his father was fred\n    -   esperance wants to keep the mob moving incase the settlers find them, the elders would rather not\n    -   her grandfather approves though, then tearfully explains the meaning behind her name: hope\n    -   natives are rebelling because they’ve heard of jacky, and devil can’t shut up either side\n    -   settlers (in a flier) found the star gang, but they kill the settlers. jacky still refuses to hold a gun\n-   chapter 17\n    -   rohan finds out johnny took down a flier\n    -   the star gang have found what seems to be a mob untouched by the settlers (i believe it’s esperance’s group?)\n    -   bagra is convincing grark that everything is ok!! i don’t think he believes her but he’s hiding that well!!\n    -   johnny says he hates what he used to call his parents, since they didn’t care for him; the rest of the gang say the complete opposite, that they love their parents. tucker says that “you monsters” (referring to the settlers including johnny) “think we don’t care about our children so you can take them away) and johnny goes “while i regret that you lump me in with them…yes, we are monsters” (not verbatim)\n    -   ******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************we put society first and family second, you are the opposite. yes, that makes us monsters compared to you.******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************\n    -   grark isn’t sure whether to believe bagra\n    -   he hears the children sing, and bagra goes “they add some weird primitive thing called harmony. it’s so weird” but he thinks it’s beautiful\n-   chapter 18\n    -   i was right. star gang found esperance\n    -   so esperance makes johnny “surrender” but like he would’ve done so anyways i presume\n    -   yayyy friendsss woooo\n    -   mel reveals to grark that the way children are treated in his presence is not in fact how they are treated normally. she explains the abuse. he asks her to testify. he asks if she was the one who had written the letter. she wasn’t. she wished she could, but she was too scared.\n    -   uh oh!! esperance warns her camp that people are coming\n-   chapter 19\n    -   grark and bagra have a…lovely conversation. he reveals he has to go soon and bagra secretly triumphs\n    -   mel wants to talk to him but bagra’s like “why?? DID YOU SEND THE LETTER”\n    -   ok grark found evidence of 1. bagra hacking the system, using his own hack and 2. bagra scaring away mel. mel has left the institution and no one can find her\n-   chapter 20\n    -   um\n    -   rohan finds the camp looking for jacky\n    -   jacky reveals himself, stabs rohan with a knife\n    -   and then jacky is shot. jacky is dead\n    -   esperance uses all her shots—even the last one, meant for her—and johnny saves her from being killed by a settler. he tells her to run. “i would run too if i had something to live for”\n    -   they find mel’s body. she’s dead from dehydration\n    -   finally grark confronts bagra, and one of the older nuns revealed that she had sent the letter rather than mel\n    -   grark W\n    -   he talks to Devil and basically says “i’m gonna report you lol have fun!”\n-   chapter 21\n    -

you can still use them?? it’s like they’re paralysed but at least paralysed legs still hold meaning, but these don’t?? they’re like meaningless dangly things wtf\n    -   it also means that ppl couldn’t hide if they remembered left legs, because it’s hard to fake a limp and stuff. which makes me wonder whether whoever the memory police are actually did this on purpose\n    -   new communication with R’s wife: let the phone ring three times, three times back if R is doing well\n    -   mc continues writing\n    -   she feels sad about old man’s death, scared of losing her memories of him\n    -   now right arms are disappeared! people not as scared because a limb has disappeared once before already…this terrifies me further because they’re already so desensitised to things disappearing even something so crucial to every day life\n    -   something that i find interesting is this: mc says that she’ll soon be no longer able to get down to his room, because of limbs disappearing, and R says that it’s okay because he’ll carry her like a princess. but then she says “how can you hold something that’s not there?” and it means that she truly cannot fathom the idea of her limbs anymore. like even if they are right in front of her, they’re not ******there.****** and that is, once again, terrifying\n    -   she describes each disappeared thing as illusions—her limbs aren’t really hers, they’re just shells\n-   **chapter 27**\n    -   in mc’s story again\n    -   girl hears someone else coming up, but she doesn’t ask for help. why? because she’s dependent on the guy already, she’s scared of going outside\n    -   and he knows that and uses that to his advantage, as he tries to steal another girl’s voice\n    -   he brings someone else up the tower—the girl—and now the protagonist is saying “this is the final moment” but i have no clue what that means\n-   ********************chapter 28********************\n    -   i’m very surprised mc managed to write all of that, considering she’s now left handed and novels are disappeared\n    -   “it’s fortunate that old man died before body parts were disappeared because i can still remember the feeling of his hand in mine” what if i sob\n    -   more body parts are disappeared, some people are glad about fewer parts to manage…\n    -   mc is worried about where her tears would go if cheeks disappeared LORD\n    -   “the citizens of the island had lost everything that had a form, and our voices alone drifted endlessly.”\n    -   everyone disappears. R climbs out of room. the end\n\n**themes**\n-   love\n-   loss\n-   memory\n-   heirarchy\n\n**questions**\n-   who’s behind the disappearances? because clearly it’s both a mind thing _**and**_ a physical thing, if fruits and flowers and birds literally disappear, but also lose meaning to the individual\n-   what makes mc’s mother and R different from everyone else? why can they remember but others can’t?\n-   who’s in charge of the memory police; are they causing the disappearances or are they simply going along with it, treating it as some sort of religion?\n-   why does mc never refer to old man by his name…unless he doesn’t have one?\n-   is R really called R ..\n-   and why is mc’s name never revealed? is it just not important\n-   what significance do all these water metaphors have\n-   it also means that ppl couldn’t hide if they remembered left legs, because it’s hard to fake a limp and stuff. which makes me wonder whether whoever the memory police are actually did this on purpose\n-   are there any parallels from mc’s story which she was writing, and her and R’s story? because if so, does that mean R was the one disappearing things, to trap mc in the room with him…because when mc says she’s going to disappear, telling R to just leave her, he climbs out and shuts the door and rolls the rug?? is this a good thing or a bad thing i cannot tell what the fuck\n-   at the end, did the memory police lose their form too? because mc never talked about that…were they just like everyone else. or did they remember things.\n\n**thoughts**\n-   i am terrified when they start losing limbs because things just lose Meaning and Purpose and what demonstrates this best are the disappearances of limbs\n-   i have two opinions:\n    -   one. memory police _**are**_ causing disappearances purposefully, a way to control everyone’s minds. one reason i say this is because they start to disappear things that’ll make it easier for them to find people who remember—books, limbs etc\n    -   but then, why would they allow people’s bodies in their entireity to disappear? what is a nation without it’s people? and because of unreliable narration, we don’t know whether the memory police are also losing their bodies or not, so we don’t know if they remember or not. i think they _**do**_ remember, because they’re told to go and find and destroy things related to items which have been disappeared, but who knows? i also believe they’re just going along with the flow, believing this to be some sort of god-like event.","lastmodified":"2023-02-23T09:06:38.995808953Z","tags":null},"/notes/eng/book-notes/the-thing-around-your-neck/essay-prompt-idea":{"title":"essay prompt idea","content":"18/02\n\n\"The Thing Around Your Neck\" explores how cultural identity can bring together a community, but also isolate individuals.

Various paragraphs dedicated to explaining “The Shivering” Ukamaka feels helps to create an atmosphere which communicates just how otherworldly her faith is. \n-   repetition of ideas; Chinedu and his religious beliefs, Ukamaka and Udenna. The repetition throughout the text of these characters paired with something else creates a correlation between them\n\n\u003cmark style=\"background: #90BE6D;\"\u003eHow do narrative techniques shape the reader’s understanding of a story? Identify narrative techniques in the text which may influence a reader’s understanding\u003c/mark\u003e\n-   The story is introduced through the perspective (in third person) of Ukamaka, so our view of Chinedu is largely influenced by hers. This allows the mystery surrounding him, along with any developments about his character, to be as natural as if we were meeting him ourselves. The ideas the readers are introduced to are thoughts that Ukamaka has, which shapes our perception of Chinedu and his character.\n-   In saying this, with how often Ukamaka speaks of and thinks of Udenna, we can sympathise with Chinedu in his questioning towards the end of the story when he says “...not everything is about Udenna.”\n\n\u003cmark style=\"background: #90BE6D;\"\u003eHow do texts and literary works express the values and beliefs of a society?

Also identify any moments at which the author or narrator conveys a value judgement or point of view.\u003c/mark\u003e\n-   While Ukamaka hasn’t gotten over her ex, claiming that she was “loving an asshole” (Udenna), Chinedu challenges this with his own beliefs of what she might be experiencing, likely because he could relate to it somewhat. “Udenna did this to you and Udenna did that to you, but why did you let him? … Have you ever considered that it wasn’t love?”\n-   There’s also a difference between their faith in their religion. Ukamaka describes Chinedu’s faith with the phrase: “Your faith, it’s almost like fighting.”, and she believes that it’s a luxury to have a faith as uncritical, forceful, and impatient as his. Meanwhile Ukamaka’s faith is more shaky and more questioning, explaining how “the shivering” sometimes appears when she prays, almost a scary experience—hence the title of the story.","lastmodified":"2023-02-23T09:06:38.995808953Z","tags":null},"/notes/eng/book-notes/the-thing-around-your-neck/ttayn-notes":{"title":"!ttayn notes","content":"\n- cell one\n\t- mc's brother nnamabia is the favourite child naughty kid who once faked his mother's jewelery being stolen so he could sell it himself\n\t- his mother is so favouritism to him and not to mc\n\t- literally his punishment was to. write a report\n\t- apparently many boys his age do this where mc is from and they're popular\n\t- three years later he'd end up in prison Lol\n\t- cults are prevalent in the story and mc wonders whether nnamabia is in one\n\t- she asks \"are you in a cult\" and he says \"of course not\" as they're walking. to the police station because the police think he's in a cult\n\t- a shooting happened with some cult members during the day and there was a curfew. nnamabia did not meet the curfew and later got arrested\n\t- erm apparently he slipped money up his ass so that he'd have some in jail???\n\t- father says that he's different in jail, that it's shaken him;

grandma although a woman is so headstrong on the idea of the first born son being more important\n\t\t- \"love can bloom from a shared hatred\"\n\t\t- told in second person - almost uncomfortable, and from a western perspective it can feel weird to \"be\" the one falling in love with a cousin\n\t\t- kind of keeps you in the dark about other perspectives, especially from the brother's feelings. maybe he felt resentment for their grandma, maybe he didn't care, we don't know\n\t\t- we wonder why the grandma is the \"head\" of the family, considering she is such a strong advocate for the patriarchy despite being a woman herself. we also know that her sons and husbands are notably absent from the story, perhaps that has influenced her need for a male heir to the family\n\t\t- love between mc and cousin might have been born out of hatred but turned into something more?\n- the headstrong historian","lastmodified":"2023-02-23T09:06:38.995808953Z","tags":null},"/notes/eng/language-and-literature":{"title":"language and literature","content":"## term 1 \n### week 1\n- read \"the shivering\" from [[notes/eng/book notes/the thing around your neck/!ttayn notes|the thing around your neck]] \n- watched [[notes/eng/book notes/the thing around your neck/ted talk - chimamanda ngozi adichie (author)|ted talk]] from author\n### week 2\n- started+completed [[notes/eng/book notes/the thing around your neck/the shivering - task|the shivering - task]] in partners (setareh)\n- read all of [[notes/eng/book notes/the thing around your neck/!ttayn notes|the thing around your neck]] \n- learnt [[notes/eng/acronyms#sentence types|sentence types]] and [[notes/eng/acronyms#analysis structure|analysis structure]] \n### week 3\n- added panel notes to [[notes/eng/book notes/the thing around your neck/!ttayn notes|the thing around your neck notes]] \n- came up with [[notes/eng/book notes/the thing around your neck/essay prompt idea|essay prompt idea]]\n### week 4\n- ","lastmodified":"2023-02-23T09:06:38.995808953Z","tags":null},"/notes/jpn/grammar/%E3%81%88":{"title":"え","content":"-るといいな～wouldn't it be nice to?\n- 食べられるといいな？wouldn't it be nice to eat?\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-23T09:06:38.995808953Z","tags":null},"/notes/jpn/grammar/%E3%81%9F":{"title":"た","content":"-たり、~たりします。 do a, b, etc\n- 食べたり、飲んだり、テレビを見たりします。eat, drink, watch tv.\n\n-たほうがいいです。 had better\n- 勉強したほうがいいです。you better study.\n\n-たことがあります。 have done\n- 山に登ったことがあります。i have climbed a mountain.\n\n-たことがありません。 haven’t done\n- 泳ぐだことがありません。i have never swam.\n\n-たら、 if/when,\n- refer to [[notes/jpn/grammar/if + when|if + when]]\n\n-たあとで、 after,\n- 走った後で、寝みました。after i ran, i slept.\n\n-たばかりです。 just finished.\n- 書いたばかりです。i just finished writing.","lastmodified":"2023-02-23T09:06:38.995808953Z","tags":null},"/notes/jpn/grammar/%E3%81%A6":{"title":"て","content":"-ています。am, are, is, -ing\n- 私は食べています。i am eating.\n\n-て下さい。please\n- 止めてください！please stop!\n\n-てみます。try\n- 教えてみます。i will try teaching. \n\n-てもいいです。it's alright to\n- 読んでもいいです。you can read.\n\n-てもかまいません。it's alright to\n- 走ってもかまいません。it's alright to run.\n\n-てはなりません。must not do\n- 話しててはなりません。must not talk.\n\n-てはだめです。must not do\n- 歩いてはだめです。must not walk.\n\n-てはいけません。not allowed to \n- 笑って花生けません。not allowed to laugh.\n\n-てから、~ after,\n- 勉強してから、テレビを見ます！after studying, i will watch tv!\n\n-ても、~ even if,\n- 泳いでも、私は暑いでしょう。even if i swim, i will be hot.\n\n-てしまいます。have finished\n- 水を飲んでしまいました。i have finished drinking water.\n\n-てほしいです。want you to\n- 笑みってほしいです。i want you to smile.

\n**NAME+YEAR**\n**aim:** \n**procedure:**\n**findings:**\n**conclusions:**\n**strengths:**\n**weaknesses:** \n\"*Not all policemen find crooks smoking weed.*\"\n\n## MAGUIRE et al 2000, London Taxi Drivers\n#localisationoffunction #neuroplasticity #rmofbiologicalapproach\n**aim:** to investigate the role of the hippocampus in learning/memory in London male taxi drivers\n**procedure:** \n- quasi experiment\n- sample: 16 London taxi drivers (male and right-handed) and 50 non-taxi drivers (also male and right-handed)\n\t- taxi drivers had years of training and experience which developed their spacial recognition/awareness\n- IV - taxi driver/non-taxi driver\n- DV - volume of hippocampus, including their anterior, body, and posterior regions; measured by analysing MRI scans of participant's brains, analysed through pixel counting and VBM \n**findings:**\n- taxi drivers had greater grey matter density in the \u003cu\u003eposterior hippocampus\u003c/u\u003e compared to the control group\n- positive correlation between amount of time as a taxi driver and greater volume of right posterior hippocampus (r=0.6)\n- negative correlation between amount of time as a taxi driver and anterior hippocampal volume\n**conclusions:**\n- there are regionally specific structural differences between the hippocampi of licensed taxi drivers compared to those who are not taxi drivers\n- professional dependence on navigational skills in licensed London taxi drivers is associated with a relative redistribution of grey matter in the hippocampus\n- findings also indicate the possibility of local plasticity in the structure of a normal human brain which allows it to adapt in response to prolonged environmental stimuli\n**strengths:**\n- single blind; researcher did not know whether MRI scans belonged to taxi driver or non-taxi driver. avoids researcher bias\n- ethically sound\n**weaknesses:** \n- quasi experiment; only correlational findings\n- sampling bias due to male population, difficult to generalise results\n\n## HM: MILNER 1966\n#rmofcognitiveapproach #localisationoffunction #multistoremodelofmemory \n**aim:** to better understand the effects that the surgery had on HM\n**procedure:**\n- longitudinal case study, HM had a surgery which removed tissue from medial temporal lobe (including hippocampus)\n- used various different strategies, using method triangulation\n\t- psychometric testing; his IQ was above average\n\t- direct observation of his behaviour\n\t- interviews with HM and his family members\n\t- cognitive tests; memory tests and learning tasks\n\t- MRI to determine the extent of damage done\n**findings:**\n- HM could not acquire episodic or semantic knowledge; memory about events and information about world around him

\u003cu\u003epasses information from the cerebral cortex\u003c/u\u003e to lower brain structures, spinal cord, peripheral nerves\n- also thought to pay a role in attention, regulating arousal\n### cerebrum\n- located \u003cmark style=\"background: #90BE6D;\"\u003eabove and in front of cerebellum\u003c/mark\u003e, occupies most of the forebrain\n- consists of an \u003cu\u003eouter cerebral cortex\u003c/u\u003e, and masses of neural tissue where neurons form connections with each other + \u003cu\u003ereceive and process incoming and outgoing information\u003c/u\u003e\n- primarily responsible for everything we \u003cu\u003econsciously think, feel, do\u003c/u\u003e\n- divided into \u003cu\u003etwo hemispheres (left + right)\u003c/u\u003e \n\t- connected, largely by corpus callosum, which enables information exchange and coordinated functioning of the brain\n\t- hemispheres can be further subdivided into four areas called \u003cu\u003elobes\u003c/u\u003e\n### cerebral cortex\n- \u003cu\u003eouter layer of the brain\u003c/u\u003e\n- wrinkled and folded so it can fit into a small space\n- involved with more \u003cu\u003ecomplex mental abilities\u003c/u\u003e such as perception, learning, memory, language, thinking, problem solving\n- processes incoming sensory information and is involved in the planning of voluntary bodily movements\n- areas and functions can be generally classified into three main areas:\n1. \u003cmark style=\"background: #90BE6D;\"\u003esensory areas\u003c/mark\u003e - which receive and process sensory information\n2. \u003cmark style=\"background: #90BE6D;\"\u003emotor areas\u003c/mark\u003e - initiate voluntary movements\n3. \u003cmark style=\"background: #90BE6D;\"\u003eassociation areas\u003c/mark\u003e - which surround sensory and motor areas and deal with more complex functions that require integration from different areas\n#### hemispheric specialisation\n- the idea that \u003cu\u003eone hemisphere has specialised functions or exerts greater control over a particular function\u003c/u\u003e\n- **left hemisphere:** verbal + analytical functions\n\t- verbal functions - reading, writing, speaking etc\n\t- analytical functions - logical reasoning, critical evaluation, experimental design\n- **right hemisphere:** non verbal functions\n\t- spatial and visual thinking\n\t- recognising patterns, faces, tunes\n\t- creative thinking\n\t- emotions\n## cortical lobes of the cerebral cortex\n-  areas of the cerebral cortex that are associated with different functions\n- each hemisphere has four lobes:\n### frontal lobe\n- largest of four lobes, located in \u003cmark style=\"background: #90BE6D;\"\u003eupper forward half of each hemisphere\u003c/mark\u003e\n- responsible for planning and initiating voluntary bodily movements\n- can be further divided into:\n#### prefrontal cortex\n- located \u003cmark style=\"background: #90BE6D;\"\u003eat the front, behind the forehead\u003c/mark\u003e\n- involved with \u003cu\u003esophisticated mental abilities\u003c/u\u003e like reasoning, planning, problem solving, decision making, symbolic thinking\n- also involved with attention, \u003cu\u003eregulation and expression of emotions\u003c/u\u003e, self-awareness, aspects of personality\n- \u003cu\u003eplans required motor sequence\u003c/u\u003e, then sense instructions to premotor cortex → prepares appropriate movement sequence and sends info to primary motor cortex\n#### primary motor cortex\n- initiates + \u003cu\u003econtrols voluntary movements \u003c/u\u003ethrough its control of skeletal muscles\n- in the **left frontal lobe**, controls voluntary movements on the **right side**, vice versa\n- different areas are involved with movement of each specific body part\n- amount dedicated to a body part depends on complexity/finesse of movement\n#### parietal lobe\n- located \u003cmark style=\"background: #90BE6D;\"\u003ebehind frontal lobe\u003c/mark\u003e, occupying the upper back half of the brain (excluding rearmost area)\n- receives and \u003cu\u003eprocesses bodily/somatosensory information\u003c/u\u003e such as touch, temperature, information of muscle movement and body's position\n- the **primary somatosensory cortex** receives and processes sensory information from the skin and body parts\n#### occipital lobe\n- located at the \u003cmark style=\"background: #90BE6D;\"\u003erearmost of each hemisphere\u003c/mark\u003e\n- almost exclusively devoted to sense of \u003cu\u003evision\u003c/u\u003e\n- largest area of the occipital lobe is primary visual cortex which is the major destination of visual information from both eyes\n#### temporal lobe\n- located in the \u003cmark style=\"background: #90BE6D;\"\u003elower, central area of the brain, above and around the top of each ear\u003c/mark\u003e\n- involved with \u003cu\u003eauditory perception\u003c/u\u003e, and plays an important role in memory, aspects of visual perception (identifying objects/faces) and emotional responses to sensory information and memories\n- **primary auditory cortex** receives and processes sound from both ears\n- \u003cmark style=\"background: #4D908E;\"\u003ebroca's area\u003c/mark\u003e\n\t- case study of \"tan\" 1861, [[notes/psych/research method/quantitative research methods#case studies|longitudinal design]] \n\t- louis leborgne lost ability to speak at age 30, only able to pronounce \"tan\". all other intellectual capacities remained\n\t- loss of articulated speech is now known as Broca's aphasia\n\t- autopsy revealed lesion in the frontal area of the \u003cmark style=\"background: #90BE6D;\"\u003eleft hemisphere\u003c/mark\u003e\n- \u003cmark style=\"background: #4D908E;\"\u003ewernicke's area\u003c/mark\u003e\n\t- located in the \u003cmark style=\"background: #90BE6D;\"\u003etemporal lobe of dominant hemisphere\u003c/mark\u003e\n\t- responsible for \u003cu\u003ecomprehension of written and spoken language\u003c/u\u003e\n\t- people with wernicke's aphasia have a general impairment of language comprehension, but speech is still intact\n## lateralisation\n- the idea that (some) functions in the brain are specific to one hemisphere\n- sperry and gazzaniga researched 4 split brain patients (patients whose corpus callosum had been surgically cut to reduce severe epilepsy) \n- aim was to test the theory of lateralisation and to see if two hemispheres have uniquely different functions\n- when a picture of a spoon was shown to the left visual field, and ask to name/describe what they saw, patients said nothing, but when asked to pick up the object they did so successfully - **supports that lateralisation of language is in the left hemisphere**\n- when a simple word (eg pencil) was flashed to the right hemisphere, patients were able to pick the pencil from the group of objects - **supports that language production \u003cu\u003eis not exclusive\u003c/u\u003e to the left hemisphere** \n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-23T09:06:38.995808953Z","tags":null}}
