  introduced to setting…somewhat\n    -   two seperate povs kind of: one of the “natives” and the “settlers”\n    -   we meet jacky, a native, who ran?? somewhere. absconded. he was taken away from his family but remembers them, remembers he had a family and a home\n    -   and some settlers who are determined to educate the souls of the natives “if they even had souls”\n    -   we know the settlers think of natives as almost sub-human\n-   chapter 2\n    -   jacky continues running, “absconding”\n    -   his only weapon is a kitchen knife he stole\n    -   he remembers a little as he keeps running\n-   chapter 3\n    -   introduced to head of the department of the protection of natives, aka “devil”\n        -   “i don’t need my real name anyways. names are for people to identify with. everyone already knows who i am.”\n    -   he denies every request the natives present…asshole\n    -   he hates the landscape here as he hates the natives, then choosing to replace his hate for the natives with pity, thinking of them as children who need to be saved\n    -   also introduced to esperance, a second gen native born in camp\n    -   she describes that everyone in their camp longs for a home they don’t have\n    -   she wishes to go home, but this camp is the closest thing she has to “home”, so she doesn’t want to leave\n-   chapter 4\n    -   introduced to sargeant rohan, apprehensive to finding jacky\n    -   he thinks that the natives should be grateful for living in these camps, rather than living “pointless, aimless lives in the dirt like they always had.”\n    -   he thinks their only ambitions are to drink, breed, and escape\n    -   he brings some men along with him to hunt and kill jacky; they all find some wicked pleasure in hunting natives like wild animals out of hate\n    -   jacky ran into a nun who told him where to go oh no he forgot his shoes\n-   chapter 5\n    -   we meet johnny star, a settler who ran away and meets tucker, a native\n    -   he assumes tucker doesn’t know english…he does\n    -   explores the idea of the stolen children, how it’s easier to manipulate them when taken younger\n-   chapter 6\n    -   rohan and his men continue searching for jacky (failing)\n-   chapter 7\n    -   explores more of johnny’s group; tucker and others, where johnny is their leader\n    -   explores how different johnny is from the natives around him; he doesn’t appreciate the food or the landscape, yet he still thinks the natives don’t deserve to be treated the way they are\n    -   jacky…continues running\n    -   someone stole some flour and rohan decides to blame it on jacky as an excuse\n-   chapter 8\n    -   sister bagra receives a letter from back home(?) that an investigator is being sent regarding claims that she’s mistreating the natives, along with the entire colony mistreating them\n    -   she Does Not like this, saying that “anyone that has trained animals would surely know that only a firm hand can teach them” and “even little children must be disciplined” once again dehumanising them\n    -   johnny is about to die of hunger BUT at least he has the power of friendship and doesn’t hate himself!!!\n-   chapter 9\n    -   jacky. is running.\n    -   johnny and his gang share stories the depressing kind\n    -   rohan asks “their” native for water. he finds water in a tree\n    -   “their” native runs away at night. go him!\n    -   ohhhh mel was the one who sent the letter about sister bagra\n    -   someone informs esperance that rohan went into their camp looking for water probably\n-   chapter 10\n    -   the quote at the start is supposedly written in 2041, so we know terra nullius is like a dystopia based on the past…\n-   chapter 11\n    -   bagra decided to discipline all of the children rather than the individuals involved, because “they all looked the same to her” verbatim\n        -   bcs of a few chapters ago (i forgot) where someone was hiding the fact that some natives ran away and they brought them back idk…\n    -   bagra is blaming this on jacky, for breaking in, because those she is “taking care” of also aspire to have a home, and the nuns are doubting whether the children can be or should be tamed\n    -   she strongly believes that the natives shouldn’t need to look for their other home because their home is right herre and she doesn’t understand why they want to look so badly\n    -   she sends a letter to “devil” to hurry up catching jacky because apparently that’ll solve all her problems\n-   chapter 12\n    -   johnny star is Dying of dehydration, his gang has left him and he doesn’t know why because he’s currently delirious (either they abandoned him or are finding water)\n    -   he mentioned how some troopers would rather kill themselves than die of dehydration, “dry death”, but he was too stubborn to do so—he believed, he hoped that water would come\n    -   he starts thinking of his “home”, where it wasn’t dry\n    -   he thinks of his childhood which he hated, for its intense structure and mental inflexibility\n        -   bcs he was disobedient\n        -   he was in fights often\n    -   he was almost brought to jail then, and now thinks that “jail would have been the easier fate”\n-   chapter 13\n    -   jacky is still trying to find jerramungup\n    -   he is Lost\n    -   he meets johnny who is literally gasping for water\n    -   he refers to him as Toad, as the natives refer to the settlers\n    -   jacky wonders whether his kindness to johnny is out of trained compassion for settlers, or out of his own humanity\n    -   johnny says thank you (a first for jacky, coming from a settler) and he resists calling him “master” as he is conditioned to\n    -   now he’s looking for water\n-   chapter 14\n    -   esperance hopes for her family, her mob, to “learn to sing in harmony like the magpies”\n    -   her plan is that if they were overrun by settlers, the last bullet in her gun was for herself….\n    -   esperance speaks of a woman, livia, who was so badly traumatised she screamed a lot, often not completely conscious\n    -   when she was conscious, her story was pieced together: she came from like a baby farm?? and they’d inject something so that all the women would give birth\n    -   the new gen of farmed babies (i personally have chosen to call them this) were a lot more robotic, than the older gen. still human, yes, but esperance describes how nothing they do is unnecessary, while the older gen are much more rebellious—human\n    -   and these new kids were all the same sickly white skin tone, like porcelain\n    -   esperance’s grandfather, after hearing this story, taught her how to use the gun (without bullets as they had none to spare)\n    -   esperance thinks the settlers value their livestock more than the natives (she’s probably right)\n    -   jacky approaches johnny again, except johnny’s gang is back. when he gets closer, the gang asks why jacky didn’t kill him, when johnny was so helpless, why jacky didn’t rid the world of a settler. jacky explains that it was ********because******** he was so helpless, that jacky couldn’t kill him. johnny thanks him once again, and jacky describes him as human\n-   chapter 15\n    -   esperance’s grandfather tells the story of his experience with the invasion—then apologises to esperance that her grandmother died giving birth to her mother, and now esperance is the only one he has left. he disappears into the bush before esperance has a chance to tell him it’s not his fault\n    -   bagra is (with an illegally downloaded program) looking through security cameras to try and find evidence that mel is up to no good. she is failing\n    -   because mel shows more kindness to the natives than the other nuns did, bagra was suspicious of her, yet she couldn’t find any evidence that she was the one who had sent in the complaint mail\n    -   she snoops around mel’s room, finds nothing, leaves\n    -   jacky keeps talking of jerramungup in like a dreamy tone and everyone around him is telling him to shut up (/lh) and goes “we just need a map” but he knows it’s Not That Simple\n    -   rohan learns from a native informant that johnny and jacky are working together now!! and that makes life harder for him since he believes johnny is able to hide them even more efficiently\n    -   some random settler farmer told rohan she saw the star gang and they robbed her but because they had guns she and her husband did nothing. and now her husband is going to try and (illegally) hunt natives. which means there is a legal way to do it. anyways rohan has no choice but to report it (he is kind of sad about this)\n    -   grark is being led through the breeding facility and is Disgusted, he wants to stop it but has to pretend that he is Not Disgusted\n    -   he writes the report but remembers that mail takes a long time to send back but he sends it anyways cuz what choice does he have\n    -   turns out he’s the investigator for bagra’s missionary\n-   chapter 16\n    -   johnny and gang have obtained map! yippee\n    -   it’s very futuristic; a holo. johnny explains how he got rid of paper 2d maps and gps from rebel humans…seems like everywhere is rlly strict in this dystopia\n    -   jacky asks why johnny isn’t “home”, johnny explains that he’d probably die if he was caught\n    -   they reach jerramungup…to find that jacky’s parents both died from the invasion…\n    -   jacky was originally named fred junior as his father was fred\n    -   esperance wants to keep the mob moving incase the settlers find them, the elders would rather not\n    -   her grandfather approves though, then tearfully explains the meaning behind her name: hope\n    -   natives are rebelling because they’ve heard of jacky, and devil can’t shut up either side\n    -   settlers (in a flier) found the star gang, but they kill the settlers. jacky still refuses to hold a gun\n-   chapter 17\n    -   rohan finds out johnny took down a flier\n    -   the star gang have found what seems to be a mob untouched by the settlers (i believe it’s esperance’s group?)\n    -   bagra is convincing grark that everything is ok!! i don’t think he believes her but he’s hiding that well!!\n    -   johnny says he hates what he used to call his parents, since they didn’t care for him; the rest of the gang say the complete opposite, that they love their parents. tucker says that “you monsters” (referring to the settlers including johnny) “think we don’t care about our children so you can take them away) and johnny goes “while i regret that you lump me in with them…yes, we are monsters” (not verbatim)\n    -   ******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************we put society first and family second, you are the opposite. yes, that makes us monsters compared to you.******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************\n    -   grark isn’t sure whether to believe bagra\n    -   he hears the children sing, and bagra goes “they add some weird primitive thing called harmony. it’s so weird” but he thinks it’s beautiful\n-   chapter 18\n    -   i was right. star gang found esperance\n    -   so esperance makes johnny “surrender” but like he would’ve done so anyways i presume\n    -   yayyy friendsss woooo\n    -   mel reveals to grark that the way children are treated in his presence is not in fact how they are treated normally. she explains the abuse. he asks her to testify. he asks if she was the one who had written the letter. she wasn’t. she wished she could, but she was too scared.\n    -   uh oh!! esperance warns her camp that people are coming\n-   chapter 19\n    -   grark and bagra have a…lovely conversation. he reveals he has to go soon and bagra secretly triumphs\n    -   mel wants to talk to him but bagra’s like “why?? DID YOU SEND THE LETTER”\n    -   ok grark found evidence of 1. bagra hacking the system, using his own hack and 2. bagra scaring away mel. mel has left the institution and no one can find her\n-   chapter 20\n    -   um\n    -   rohan finds the camp looking for jacky\n    -   jacky reveals himself, stabs rohan with a knife\n    -   and then jacky is shot. jacky is dead\n    -   esperance uses all her shots—even the last one, meant for her—and johnny saves her from being killed by a settler. he tells her to run. “i would run too if i had something to live for”\n    -   they find mel’s body. she’s dead from dehydration\n    -   finally grark confronts bagra, and one of the older nuns revealed that she had sent the letter rather than mel\n    -   grark W\n    -   he talks to Devil and basically says “i’m gonna report you lol have fun!”\n-   chapter 21\n    -

you can still use them?? it’s like they’re paralysed but at least paralysed legs still hold meaning, but these don’t?? they’re like meaningless dangly things wtf\n    -   it also means that ppl couldn’t hide if they remembered left legs, because it’s hard to fake a limp and stuff. which makes me wonder whether whoever the memory police are actually did this on purpose\n    -   new communication with R’s wife: let the phone ring three times, three times back if R is doing well\n    -   mc continues writing\n    -   she feels sad about old man’s death, scared of losing her memories of him\n    -   now right arms are disappeared! people not as scared because a limb has disappeared once before already…this terrifies me further because they’re already so desensitised to things disappearing even something so crucial to every day life\n    -   something that i find interesting is this: mc says that she’ll soon be no longer able to get down to his room, because of limbs disappearing, and R says that it’s okay because he’ll carry her like a princess. but then she says “how can you hold something that’s not there?” and it means that she truly cannot fathom the idea of her limbs anymore. like even if they are right in front of her, they’re not ******there.****** and that is, once again, terrifying\n    -   she describes each disappeared thing as illusions—her limbs aren’t really hers, they’re just shells\n-   **chapter 27**\n    -   in mc’s story again\n    -   girl hears someone else coming up, but she doesn’t ask for help. why? because she’s dependent on the guy already, she’s scared of going outside\n    -   and he knows that and uses that to his advantage, as he tries to steal another girl’s voice\n    -   he brings someone else up the tower—the girl—and now the protagonist is saying “this is the final moment” but i have no clue what that means\n-   ********************chapter 28********************\n    -   i’m very surprised mc managed to write all of that, considering she’s now left handed and novels are disappeared\n    -   “it’s fortunate that old man died before body parts were disappeared because i can still remember the feeling of his hand in mine” what if i sob\n    -   more body parts are disappeared, some people are glad about fewer parts to manage…\n    -   mc is worried about where her tears would go if cheeks disappeared LORD\n    -   “the citizens of the island had lost everything that had a form, and our voices alone drifted endlessly.”\n    -   everyone disappears. R climbs out of room. the end\n\n**themes**\n-   love\n-   loss\n-   memory\n-   heirarchy\n\n**questions**\n-   who’s behind the disappearances? because clearly it’s both a mind thing _**and**_ a physical thing, if fruits and flowers and birds literally disappear, but also lose meaning to the individual\n-   what makes mc’s mother and R different from everyone else? why can they remember but others can’t?\n-   who’s in charge of the memory police; are they causing the disappearances or are they simply going along with it, treating it as some sort of religion?\n-   why does mc never refer to old man by his name…unless he doesn’t have one?\n-   is R really called R ..\n-   and why is mc’s name never revealed? is it just not important\n-   what significance do all these water metaphors have\n-   it also means that ppl couldn’t hide if they remembered left legs, because it’s hard to fake a limp and stuff. which makes me wonder whether whoever the memory police are actually did this on purpose\n-   are there any parallels from mc’s story which she was writing, and her and R’s story? because if so, does that mean R was the one disappearing things, to trap mc in the room with him…because when mc says she’s going to disappear, telling R to just leave her, he climbs out and shuts the door and rolls the rug?? is this a good thing or a bad thing i cannot tell what the fuck\n-   at the end, did the memory police lose their form too? because mc never talked about that…were they just like everyone else. or did they remember things.\n\n**thoughts**\n-   i am terrified when they start losing limbs because things just lose Meaning and Purpose and what demonstrates this best are the disappearances of limbs\n-   i have two opinions:\n    -   one. memory police _**are**_ causing disappearances purposefully, a way to control everyone’s minds. one reason i say this is because they start to disappear things that’ll make it easier for them to find people who remember—books, limbs etc\n    -   but then, why would they allow people’s bodies in their entireity to disappear? what is a nation without it’s people? and because of unreliable narration, we don’t know whether the memory police are also losing their bodies or not, so we don’t know if they remember or not. i think they _**do**_ remember, because they’re told to go and find and destroy things related to items which have been disappeared, but who knows? i also believe they’re just going along with the flow, believing this to be some sort of god-like event.","lastmodified":"2023-10-16T21:39:49.173247918Z","tags":null},"/notes/eng/text-notes/the-thing-around-your-neck/essay-prompt-idea":{"title":"essay prompt idea","content":"18/02\n\n\"The Thing Around Your Neck\" explores how cultural identity can bring together a community, but also isolate individuals.

Various paragraphs dedicated to explaining “The Shivering” Ukamaka feels helps to create an atmosphere which communicates just how otherworldly her faith is. \n-   repetition of ideas; Chinedu and his religious beliefs, Ukamaka and Udenna. The repetition throughout the text of these characters paired with something else creates a correlation between them\n\n\u003cmark style=\"background: #90BE6D;\"\u003eHow do narrative techniques shape the reader’s understanding of a story? Identify narrative techniques in the text which may influence a reader’s understanding\u003c/mark\u003e\n-   The story is introduced through the perspective (in third person) of Ukamaka, so our view of Chinedu is largely influenced by hers. This allows the mystery surrounding him, along with any developments about his character, to be as natural as if we were meeting him ourselves. The ideas the readers are introduced to are thoughts that Ukamaka has, which shapes our perception of Chinedu and his character.\n-   In saying this, with how often Ukamaka speaks of and thinks of Udenna, we can sympathise with Chinedu in his questioning towards the end of the story when he says “...not everything is about Udenna.”\n\n\u003cmark style=\"background: #90BE6D;\"\u003eHow do texts and literary works express the values and beliefs of a society?

Also identify any moments at which the author or narrator conveys a value judgement or point of view.\u003c/mark\u003e\n-   While Ukamaka hasn’t gotten over her ex, claiming that she was “loving an asshole” (Udenna), Chinedu challenges this with his own beliefs of what she might be experiencing, likely because he could relate to it somewhat. “Udenna did this to you and Udenna did that to you, but why did you let him? … Have you ever considered that it wasn’t love?”\n-   There’s also a difference between their faith in their religion. Ukamaka describes Chinedu’s faith with the phrase: “Your faith, it’s almost like fighting.”, and she believes that it’s a luxury to have a faith as uncritical, forceful, and impatient as his. Meanwhile Ukamaka’s faith is more shaky and more questioning, explaining how “the shivering” sometimes appears when she prays, almost a scary experience—hence the title of the story.","lastmodified":"2023-10-16T21:39:49.173247918Z","tags":null},"/notes/eng/text-notes/the-thing-around-your-neck/ttayn-notes":{"title":"!ttayn notes","content":"\n- cell one\n\t- mc's brother nnamabia is the favourite child naughty kid who once faked his mother's jewelery being stolen so he could sell it himself\n\t- his mother is so favouritism to him and not to mc\n\t- literally his punishment was to. write a report\n\t- apparently many boys his age do this where mc is from and they're popular\n\t- three years later he'd end up in prison Lol\n\t- cults are prevalent in the story and mc wonders whether nnamabia is in one\n\t- she asks \"are you in a cult\" and he says \"of course not\" as they're walking. to the police station because the police think he's in a cult\n\t- a shooting happened with some cult members during the day and there was a curfew. nnamabia did not meet the curfew and later got arrested\n\t- erm apparently he slipped money up his ass so that he'd have some in jail???\n\t- father says that he's different in jail, that it's shaken him;

chika lost her sister, the woman lost her daughter\n\t\t- it's sort of about overcoming the bias that media and social stereotypes put on various social groups, in this case islam, and how these humane experiences in the middle of such inhumane circumstances can really stand out\n\t\t- gives us a new perspective into the religious aspect and political aspect of nigeria\n- ghosts\n\t- we get backstory on the war, his relationship\n\t- it's in single perspective so it's very vague on whether what we're hearing from him is real or not\n\t- because he says that his wife visits him every day despite her being dead, and the person he's talking to supposedly died 37 years ago so\n- on monday of last week\n\t- \n- jumping monkey hill\n\t- how during the process of writer's workshop, ujunwa writes something about her own life\n\t- the workshop is seen as a very \"perfect\" place\n\t- at the end, everyone else in the story says \"wowwww so unrealistic\" and she goes \"Bitch this was my monday morning\"\n- the thing around your neck\n\t- someone won american visa lottery yayyyy her name is akunna\n\t- so she's taken in by her \"uncle\" but he sexually assaults her\n\t- and now she's gone to get a job\n\t- later she meets a white guy who knows about african culture butttt it's more of a white guy romanticising thing\n\t- but he pays attention to her\n\t- so she dates him\n\t- thing around your neck is like the suffocating feeling she has\n\t- her dad dies and she leaves him (or does she!!!!1!!!1!!1)\n- the american embassy\n\t- story about someone...waiting in front of the american embassy....for an asylum visa\n\t- her husband is a career-focused \"selfish\" (according to mc) news journalist who got smuggled over the border\n\t- when officials come to find him they end up shooting her son bcs they were drunk\n\t- so now she's seeking asylum\n\t- when she's applying she ends up walking out of the office??@? idk whyyyyy possibly because she wants to stay in nigeria for her culture, \"refusing to give herself up to america\" (from panel) \n- the shivering\n\t- ukamaka is a nigerian woman in college, worrying over a major plane crash in nigeria, as she believes that her ex, udenna, might have been aboard it \n\t- chinedu makes himself known as a fellow nigerian in her apartment suite and asks if they can pray together, ukamaka later telling him that she’s worried because her ex might have been on the flight. fortunately, through a call, she finds that he had missed his flight and is safe. \n\t- their friendship develops, driven mostly by ukamaka “need to rant” about her ex to chinedu \n\t- they discuss from the beginning to the end of the text about faith, specifically towards god - ukamaka is catholic and chinedu is pentecostal, though it seems his faith is a lot stronger than hers chinedu is an ambiguous character- unknown at first but slowly he reveals more about himself \n\t- once ukamaka relates chinedu’s struggles with love to her own, mentioning udenna once again, he snaps somewhat, and she tells him to get out of her apartment. \n\t- for a week they cut contact with each other\n\t- ukamaka knocks on chinedu’s door to apologise \n\t- incapable of finding the words, ukamaka instead asks if chinedu is working on a dissertation, to which he replies that he is busy before closing the door on her face \n\t- they go another week without contact until the following sunday when ukamaka showed up at chinedu’s door and apologised \n\t- chinedu opens up to ukamaka and tells her that is he at risk of deportation since his visa expired three years ago \n\t- ukamaka shows puzzle which grows into admiration for chinendu’s faith \n\t- they go to mass together the enddddd\n- the arrangers of marriage\n- tomorrow is too far\n\t- INCEST\n\t- they kill brother!!\n\t- sheeeeeeesh\n\t- it's giving first born son with privileges vs second born daughter who hates him\n\t- **panel notes:**\n\t\t- portrays thin line between hatred and love\n\t\t- also an irony of the patriarchy; grandma although a woman is so headstrong on the idea of the first born son being more important\n\t\t- \"love can bloom from a shared hatred\"\n\t\t- told in second person - almost uncomfortable, and from a western perspective it can feel weird to \"be\" the one falling in love with a cousin\n\t\t- kind of keeps you in the dark about other perspectives, especially from the brother's feelings. maybe he felt resentment for their grandma, maybe he didn't care, we don't know\n\t\t- we wonder why the grandma is the \"head\" of the family, considering she is such a strong advocate for the patriarchy despite being a woman herself. we also know that her sons and husbands are notably absent from the story, perhaps that has influenced her need for a male heir to the family\n\t\t- love between mc and cousin might have been born out of hatred but turned into something more?\n- the headstrong historian\n\t- mother sends son to catholic school in hopes of helping him learn english to have an advantage/protection which kind of made him distanced from his culture\n\t- and this his daughter, grace (take note of the christian name), realised she didn't have as much culture as she thought she did\n\t- she *is* the headstrong historian woah\n\t- as grandma was close to death the son begged her to be baptised because he didn't want to partake in a \"heathen\" ceremony oww\n\t- **panel notes:**\n\t\t- close third person perspective but through the grandma, rather than grace\n\t\t- grandma's intent was just to have some sort of protection with speaking english, whereas he took it \"too far\" and became a son she didn't know - when asked about her name, her son said an anglo name rather than her real name\n\t\t- grandmother's journey with accepting her son's change is similar to five stages of grief; denial and then acceptance etc, slow change but change nonetheless\n\t\t- grandma was hoping that her son was her husband's soul reborn (again, the denial) to feel safe, and then when grace was born she realised that her \"husband was back\" through grace; she didn't anticipate this as much as she anticipated it for her son because of gender difference","lastmodified":"2023-10-16T21:39:49.173247918Z","tags":null},"/notes/jpn/grammar/%E3%81%88":{"title":"え","content":"-るといいな～wouldn't it be nice to?\n- 食べられるといいな？wouldn't it be nice to eat?\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-10-16T21:39:49.173247918Z","tags":null},"/notes/jpn/grammar/%E3%81%9F":{"title":"た","content":"-たり、~たりします。 do a, b, etc\n- 食べたり、飲んだり、テレビを見たりします。eat, drink, watch tv.\n\n-たほうがいいです。 had better\n- 勉強したほうがいいです。you better study.\n\n-たことがあります。 have done\n- 山に登ったことがあります。i have climbed a mountain.\n\n-たことがありません。 haven’t done\n- 泳ぐだことがありません。i have never swam.\n\n-たら、 if/when,\n- refer to [[notes/jpn/grammar/if + when|if + when]]\n\n-たあとで、 after,\n- 走った後で、寝みました。after i ran, i slept.\n\n-たばかりです。 just finished.\n- 書いたばかりです。i just finished writing.","lastmodified":"2023-10-16T21:39:49.173247918Z","tags":null},"/notes/jpn/grammar/%E3%81%A6":{"title":"て","content":"-ています。am, are, is, -ing\n- 私は食べています。i am eating.\n\n-て下さい。please\n- 止めてください！please stop!\n\n-てみます。try\n- 教えてみます。i will try teaching. \n\n-てもいいです。it's alright to\n- 読んでもいいです。you can read.\n\n-てもかまいません。it's alright to\n- 走ってもかまいません。it's alright to run.\n\n-てはなりません。must not do\n- 話しててはなりません。must not talk.\n\n-てはだめです。must not do\n- 歩いてはだめです。must not walk.\n\n-てはいけません。not allowed to \n- 笑って花生けません。not allowed to laugh.\n\n-てから、~ after,\n- 勉強してから、テレビを見ます！after studying, i will watch tv!\n\n-ても、~ even if,\n- 泳いでも、私は暑いでしょう。even if i swim, i will be hot.\n\n-てしまいます。have finished\n- 水を飲んでしまいました。i have finished drinking water.\n\n-てほしいです。want you to\n- 笑みってほしいです。i want you to smile.

For fellow Nigerians, Igbo people, and those who could identify with the various other cultures and ethnic groups written in the text, is this a way of uplifting and representing these experiences, in the face of those who \"only know one story of Africa\"? Is it an opportunity to feel seen in text, or for them to find out more about their culture, which has been colonised and erased in so many ways? \n\nAnd to everyone else, I think it might have been just that, a way to express the many stories of a community with so many fresh perspectives. For us who have only ever heard the singular story told through the mouths of white colonisers, this novel is refreshing and insightful to explore, with so many perspectives to unpack. I also think this connection of experiences between the reader and the text isn't limited to those who are Nigerian, as I'm sure many can relate to the erasure of culture and assimilation into a forced society, though obviously not in the exact same ways. \n\nThis also leads me to wonder whether our western or non-Nigerian view on the text has an impact on what we deem as normal, right, specifically referring to what I initially interpreted as blunt and detailed descriptions of nudity, incest and sexual activities.

How has my limited understanding of other cultures affected how I have read this text?\n\nI also wonder where these stories stem from; whether some of these are retold events from Adichie's life, or people she had interviewed, or a fictional yet real retelling of historical events she had researched.

They exist in all mammals, regardless of sex, and have uses including signalling that they are ready to mate. The existence of pheromones in humans, however, is largely debated, as there has been no identified pheromones within humans.  There has been much research completed on the topic; Wedekind et al 1995 did research on the effects of MHC (a set of genes related to the immune system) on human sexual attraction, while Zhou et al 2014 completed research on the effects of AND and EST on human sexual behaviour. \n\nWedekind et al 1995 investigated the effects of MHC, by testing whether females would rate sweaty t-shirts as more attractive if it was from a man with different MHC genes to her own. The sample included 49 females and 44 males, who had their immune system genes tested. The males were asked to wear a plain white t-shirt for two days. The t-shirts were then placed in closed boxes, and the females were asked to smell them and rate them on two factors: pleasantness and sexiness. It was found that women rated the sweaty t-shirts as more pleasant and sexy if they came from a man with different MHC genes to themselves. From this, it was then concluded that people are more likely to find a mate with different MHC genes and therefore higher difference in immune systems to their own, to ensure that their offspring will have stronger immune systems. A strength of this study was how potential extraneous variables were handled. For example, male participants were asked to use odourless soaps, to ensure that the smell of the sweaty t-shirts was unaffected by other fragrances. This allowed for the results to remain accurate. However, the links between this study to pheromones are ambiguous, as MHC is not classified as a pheromone; though it was concluded that MHC influences human attraction, it cannot be said that therefore pheromones influence human attraction.\n\nAnother study related to pheromones was conducted by Zhou et al in 2014, which investigated the effects of AND and EST on heterosexual and homosexual men and women. The sample included four groups: heteosexual females, heterosexual males, homosexual females, and homosexual males, who were all healthy. Participants watched stick figures on a screen, and were asked to guess the stick figure's gender. While watching, they were exposed to the smell of cloves; in the experimental condition, the cloves were mixed with AND, and in the control condition only the smell of cloves was present. It was found that heterosexual females and homosexual males had higher rates of identifying the stick figure as \"masculine\" when exposed to AND than the control group, while AND had no significant effect on heterosexual men or homosexual women in identifying the stick figure's gender. It was then concluded that AND may have some effect on human sexual behaviour. A similar experiment was conducted with EST rather than AND, and had similar results where EST had significant effects on heterosexual males but not as significant effects for homosexual females. The study was highly standardised and therefore easy to replicate, and also had an inclusive sample which allowed for differing sexual orientations. However, despite these strengths, the study's ecological validity is questionable; the level of AND presented to participants was much higher than the natural amount present in humans. Therefore, the effects of AND in a practical situation may not match what was found in the study; the study is argued to be too artificial to apply in real life. \n\nThese studies do show change in sexual behaviour and attraction from the sense of smell, however it is questionable whether they can be used in order to support the existence of human pheromones. Though the ecological validity in Wedekind et al 1995 was strong, the same cannot be said for Zhou et al 2014. Along with this, MHC, AND, and EST are not classified as human pheromones, meaning that despite the correlations between smell and sexual behaviour and attraction, more research needs to be completed in order to establish whether human pheromones exist, and to what extent they effect human behaviours.

There are various reasons for this, including that research can be carried out over a shorter period of time whilst still studying the full lifespan of the animal/s. Because some animals and humans are genetically similar, what is found through the animals models could be generalised to humans; however, the validity of these generalisations can be questioned, especially as humans and animals are not completely identical. Two studies which investigated the effects of oxytocin on animal behaviour and human behaviour include Romero et al and Scheele et al. \n\nRomero et al used animal models to complete their research on the effects of oxytocin on the behaviour of dogs. The sample consisted of dogs which were all intranasally sprayed with either oxytocin or a placebo, and all were then placed into a room with their owner and another dog. The owner was asked to sit quietly in a chair and move it every ten minutes, and to not interact with their dog. The behaviour of the dogs was recorded through camera over the course of an hour. It was found that the dogs who had been intranasally sprayed with oxytocin showed more affection towards their owners than those who had been sprayed with the placebo—this affection included behaviours such as following their owner, licking, and sniffing. This affection was also observed for the other dog placed in the room. It was concluded that oxytocin played a role in maintaining social bonds between mammals. This study used a double-blind counterbalance, in order to minimise bias in the researchers, the owners, and the dogs themselves. A placebo spray was also used on the dogs along with the oxytocin spray on the dogs as well. However, the sample size was small, and therefore the generalisability of this study is limited. Like all animal studies, the dogs were not able to give consent, and were also unable to withdraw.\n\nA study on the effects of oxytocin on human behaviour is Scheele et al, with two tasks that specifically focused on human fidelity. The sample consisted of heterosexual men who were either in a monogamous relationship or were single. Once again, either oxytocin or a placebo was intranasally sprayed for each of the participants, who were then positioned on one end of a room. On the other end was an “attractive” female. Participants were asked to slowly move towards the female and stop at a distance where they felt slightly uncomfortable. It was found that males in a relationship who were given the dose of oxytocin stood significantly further apart from the female than those who had been given the placebo. However, the distance between single males who were given the dose of oxytocin and the female was not significantly different from those who were given the placebo. It was concluded that oxytocin played a role in fidelity in non-single men, as it caused them to stay further away from a female who was not his partner. Again, a double blind was used in order to minimise bias from both the researchers and the participants, along with the use of independent measures. Limitations of this study include confounding variables in regards to the participants—the distance between participants and the female might have been influenced by another factor that wasn’t the oxytocin or placebo intranasal spray. \n\nBoth studies seem to support the theory that oxytocin plays a role in relationships, where in Romero et al these relationships were non-reproductive, compared to Scheele et al which focused on fidelity. In this sense, animal models are able to support research done on humans—in both studies, a relationship between oxytocin and behaviour has been found. However, since one study focused on dogs while the other focused on animals, the behaviours they studied were different, so any generalisations made between the two are limited. Ethical considerations in both animal models and human studies are also prevalent, though in the studies mentioned above, there were little ethical issues.\n","lastmodified":"2023-10-16T21:39:49.173247918Z","tags":null},"/notes/psych/SAQ+ERQs/ERQ-To-what-extent-is-one-cognitive-process-reliable":{"title":"ERQ - To what extent is one cognitive process reliable","content":"#cognitiveapproach #schematheory \nThe concept of reconstructive memory proposes that human memory is not an exact copy of events, and is rather a reconstructed version which can be altered through various factors—that rather than being a passive process, memory is an active process. Schemas can affect to what degree of accuracy information is encoded and how it is retrieved from the LTM. Studies which focus on the theory of reconstructive memory include Loftus and Palmer, and Yuille and Cutshall.\n\nLoftus and Palmer 1974 investigated the role of leading questions in influencing the estimation of speed. Their sample consisted of 45 students, divided into 5 separate groups. All participants were shown a series of videos of traffic accidents, and were then asked to give an account of what they had seen and fill out a questionnaire. The questions were all mostly the same, except for one question: “About how fast were the cars going when they ___ each other”, with each condition having a different word in the blank. The words included hit, collided, bumped, smashed, and contacted. It was found that for those who were given the question containing the word “smashed”, the mean estimate of speed for the cars was highest. Meanwhile, the mean estimate of speed was lowest in those who were given the word “contacted”. It was concluded that the participants’ memory of events were able to be manipulated by the leading questions. The procedure was standardised among all participants, with each student watching all videos, which reduced the amount of confounding variables present. However, the sample size was small, and consisted of students who may not have enough driving experience to estimate the speeds well. Alongside this, because these were only videos of car crashes, the ecological validity of this study is said to be low; it has been suggested that the encoding and retrieval of information might be more accurate if it had been a real accident.\n\nYuille and Cutshall 1986 had a similar aim: to investigate whether leading questions would affect the memories of eyewitnesses at a real crime scene. After a thief entered a gun shop, stole from and eventually shot the owner, 13 eyewitnesses of the crime agreed to be interviewed as part of the study. Four months after they had witnessed the crime, they were asked various questions and recalled the events they saw. Half of the group were asked if they saw “a” broken headlight on the thief’s car, while the other half were asked if they saw “the” broken headlight. In reality, there was no broken headlight at all. Likewise, half the group was asked if they saw “the” yellow panel, while the other half were asked about “a” yellow panel. The panel in question was actually blue. The findings showed that 10/13 eyewitnesses recalled no broken headlight or yellow panel, or they hadn’t noticed these details. It was concluded that their recounts of the events were reliable and matched police reports. The accuracy of the witnesses compared to the police reports were significantly high. Though it had high ecological validity, as the witnessed crime was real and unfabricated, there are a few criticisms to be had with the study. The sample was small and purposive, so it is difficult to generalise the results to the public. External variables within this study were also difficult to control, so some eyewitnesses may have rehearsed the information more or less than others.\n\nYuille and Cutshall opposes the conclusion that Loftus and Palmer reached. Both studies had considerably small sample sizes, however the ecological validity of Yuille and Cutshall is much higher than that of Loftus and Palmer. Both studies used leading questions as schemas in order to investigate whether participants memories could be altered, however it can be said that the inaccuracy in the participants of Loftus and Palmer was due to lack of emotional response; a real witnessed crime would induce more emotion and this may have affected the degree of accuracy participants in Yuille and Cutshall encoded and recalled the event. Memory is shown to be somewhat reliable in some situations, and in others can be easily reconstructed through the use of schemas.","lastmodified":"2023-10-16T21:39:49.173247918Z","tags":null},"/notes/psych/SAQ+ERQs/SAQ-Evaluate-an-evolutionary-explanation-of-one-behaviour":{"title":"","content":"Sexual selection is a type of natural selection whereby mates are chosen in order to create a diverse gene pool for offspring. In terms of behaviour and evolution, there is an assumption by theorists that behaviours are genetic and can be inherited, and that such inherited behaviour will benefit future reproduction. Sexual selection is evident in humans, as shown by Buss (1989).\n\nBuss (1989) investigated three assumptions on human mate selection and evolution: that men will favour youth and physical appearance as this links to the ability to reproduce, that women will favour men with more resources because they will invest in their offspring, and that men do not want to invest in another man’s child and will therefore value abstinence. The sample was large, with over 10,000 participants from 33 different countries, and each participant completed two surveys. The first survey collected data regarding the preferred ages participants wanted to marry at, preferred age differences between participants and their spouse, who participants thought should be older in the relationship and how many children they’d want. This was followed with rating characteristics on how important the participants valued them. The second survey contained characteristics which participants were asked to rank in terms of desirability in a partner. Results showed that most women did value good financial prospects more than males did, while men valued physical attractiveness more than females. In all samples, men also preferred younger mates, with the average age being close to the peak female fertility age. However, chastity was not valued as much as the other traits. It was concluded that the first two assumptions were correct, but not the third (abstinence). From these results, it can be seen that evolution in humans is largely influenced by sexual selection, in that females prefer those with more resources, and men value youth and physical appearance—mates deemed “best” are more likely to pass on well-adapted genes to future generations. \n\n**Feedback**\nFocus - 4/9 - Intro paragraph needs more depth and should also explore the concept of evolution.

Sensory memory does not process information, and in order for this information to transfer to the STM, attention is required. The STM holds information that is encoded and not exact, and has a capacity of around 5-9 items. It has a duration of roughly 30 seconds, and requires rehearsal for information to remain in the STM. This information can then be transferred to the LTM, and if needed can be retrieved. \n\nGlanzer and Cunitz (1996) investigated the serial position effect; whether the interval of time between hearing words on a list would increase the amount of words recalled at the start of the list. The sample consisted of 240 army enlisted men, where 40 men were allocated to 6 different conditions: words read once at 3/6/9 second rate and words read twice at 3/6/9 second rate. After being given some practice lists to get used to the procedure, all participants listened to recordings of 20-word lists, which were standardised and contained the same words. After listening, participants were asked to write down the words they recalled in any order. It was found that participants with increased intervals of time between words led to more words being recalled, except for the words at the end of the lists. It can then be concluded that the primacy effect—where words from the list are recalled more frequently—is a result of rehearsal, as the increased time intervals allowed for participants to rehearse the words more. Participants couldn’t rehearse the words at the end of the list as much, and therefore they decayed from the STM.\n","lastmodified":"2023-10-16T21:39:49.173247918Z","tags":null},"/notes/psych/SAQ+ERQs/SAQ-Explain-one-study-of-how-emotion-may-affect-one-cognitive-process":{"title":"SAQ - Explain one study of how emotion may affect one cognitive process","content":"#flashbulbmemory #cognitiveapproach \nAn example of how emotions are able to influence memory is flashbulb memory. These are vivid memories in which someone learns about an event. In order for a memory to be considered a flashbulb memory, an element of surprise must be involved, along with an element of personal significance. Because of the element of surprise or emotion, the amygdala is involved, and therefore these memories are encoded differently to regular memories. One study which investigates the theory of flashbulb memories is Sharot et al 2007.\n\nSharot investigated the role of biological factors on flashbulb memories. After the events of 9/11, 24 participants were recruited through advertisements to participate in this experiment. While under an fMRI, various words were presented on a screen to the participants. \"Summer\" and \"September\" were included in the list of words, in order to have participants make a connection to the events of 9/11 or the summer holidays. After the fMRI scan, participants were asked to rate their memories for vividness, detail, and confidence in accuracy. Half of the participants reported having a flashbulb memory, and it was these participants who had reported that they were closer to the World Trade Centre on the day of the event. It was found that for these participants, the activation of the amygdala was higher while recalling the events of 9/11. Meanwhile, for those further away from the event, the amygdala had similar activation while recalling 9/11 and while recalling their summer holidays. It was concluded that close personal experience may have a critical role in the process of creating flashbulb memories, along with the activation of the amygdala.","lastmodified":"2023-10-16T21:39:49.173247918Z","tags":null},"/notes/psych/SAQ+ERQs/SAQ-Planning-Describe-one-technique-used-to-study-the-brain":{"title":"Describe one technique used to

#neuroplasticity #rmofbiologicalapproach #biologicalapproach #techniquestostudythebrain \n**aim:** to investigate the role of the hippocampus in learning/memory in London male taxi drivers\n**procedure:** \n- quasi experiment\n- sample: 16 London taxi drivers (male and right-handed) and 50 non-taxi drivers (also male and right-handed)\n\t- taxi drivers had years of training and experience which developed their spacial recognition/awareness\n- IV - taxi driver/non-taxi driver\n- DV - volume of hippocampus, including their anterior, body, and posterior regions; measured by analysing MRI scans of participant's brains, analysed through pixel counting and VBM \n**findings:**\n- taxi drivers had greater grey matter density in the \u003cu\u003eposterior hippocampus\u003c/u\u003e compared to the control group\n- positive correlation between amount of time as a taxi driver and greater volume of right posterior hippocampus (r=0.6)\n- negative correlation between amount of time as a taxi driver and anterior hippocampal volume\n**conclusions:**\n- there are regionally specific structural differences between the hippocampi of licensed taxi drivers compared to those who are not taxi drivers\n- professional dependence on navigational skills in licensed London taxi drivers is associated with a relative redistribution of grey matter in the hippocampus\n- findings also indicate the possibility of local plasticity in the structure of a normal human brain which allows it to adapt in response to prolonged environmental stimuli\n**strengths:**\n- single blind; researcher did not know whether MRI scans belonged to taxi driver or non-taxi driver. avoids researcher bias\n- ethically sound\n**weaknesses:** \n- quasi experiment; only correlational findings\n- sampling bias due to male population, difficult to generalise results\n\n## HM: MILNER 1966, bicycle boy\n#rmofcognitiveapproach #localisationoffunction #multistoremodelofmemory #biologicalapproach #cognitiveapproach #techniquestostudythebrain \n**aim:** to better understand the effects that the surgery had on HM\n**procedure:**\n- longitudinal case study, HM had a surgery which removed tissue from medial temporal lobe (including hippocampus)\n- used various different strategies, using method triangulation\n\t- psychometric testing; his IQ was above average\n\t- direct observation of his behaviour\n\t- interviews with HM and his family members\n\t- cognitive tests; memory tests and learning tasks\n\t- MRI to determine the extent of damage done\n**findings:**\n- HM could not acquire episodic or semantic knowledge; memory about events and information about world around him respectively\n- he was however able to draw a picture of his house; cognitive knowledge\n- had capacity for working memory; was asked to remember the number 584 and could repeat it 15 minutes after, though once the task was over HM couldn't remember it\n- he knew how to mow a lawn (procedural memory)\n**conclusions:**\n- suggests that surgery removed brain structures which contributed to moving memories from short-term to long-term\n- he could draw a photo of his house, suggesting that cognitive memory is not encoded in the same way as semantic or episodic\n- suggests short-term memory is not stored in hippocampus \n- suggests that medial temporal lobe is not site of permanent storage, but organises and stores elsewhere in the brain \n**strengths:**\n- longitudinal+method triangulation \n- ecological validity - less extraneous variables\n- very ethically sound\n**weaknesses:** \n- cannot easily be replicated\n- retrospective; we did not know much about HM before the incident\n- hard to generalise\n## DRAGNISKI et al 2004, juggling\n#neuroplasticity #neuralpruning #synapses #biologicalapproach #techniquestostudythebrain \n**aim:** to see whether learning a new skill (juggling in this case) would have an effect on the brains of the participants\n**procedure:**\n- type of study: experimental\n- 24 volunteers between ages 20-24; 21 females and 3 males, all non-jugglers at the start of the study\n- everyone had an MRI scan at the start of the study, then the sample was separated into two groups: jugglers and non-jugglers\n- jugglers were taught how to juggle, then asked to practice. when they had mastered it they would contact the researchers and have another MRI scan\n- non-juggling group was the control\n- three months after that, another MRI scan was taken\n**findings:**\n- MRIs analysed using VBM\n- after they had mastered juggling, jugglers had significantly larger amounts of grey matter in the mid-temporal lobe in both hemispheres (associated with visual memory)\n- the final MRI showed that this grey matter had decreased\n**conclusions:**\n- suggests that learning a new skill changes the grey matter density in the respective part of the brain, supporting neuroplasticity\n- and that as skills are less used, neural pruning occurs.\n- juggling relies more on visual memory than spatial??\n**strengths:**\n- \n**weaknesses:** \n- small sample size\n- internal validity issues; participants were at home for most of the experiment, many extraneous variables\n## CROCKETT et al 2010, trolley dilemma\n#neurotransmission #agonist #biologicalapproach \n**aim:** to see whether citalopram, an SSRI, affects pro-social behaviour\n**procedure:** \n- repeated measures experimental design\n- sample: 30 healthy subjects, mean age was 26\n- experimental group: participants given a does of citalopram (which blocks reuptake of serotonin from the synapse+boosts concentration)\n- control group: was given a placebo\n- research was double-blind study\n- after taking the drug, participants were given a series of moral dilemmas that involved impersonal situations like the trolley problem (saving five people and killing one, or vice versa) or personal situations (pushing a man off a bridge to stop a train from killing five people)\n**findings:**\n- responses in the impersonal version were unaffected by citalopram\n- after one dose of citalopram, participants were less likely to push the man off the bridge in the personal scenario, than participants in the placebo condition\n**conclusions:**\n- serotonin reduces acceptability of personal harm, and in this way promotes prosocial behaviour\n- serotonin modulates reactions of the brain to emotinoally salient situations so that inflicting harm on other people is judged as less acceptable\n**strengths:**\n**weaknesses:** authors recognised that citalopram intake induced slight nausea, which could mean that participants could work out whether they were in the experimental on control group\n## FISHER, ARON \u0026 BROWN 2005, dopamine and Love\n#neurotransmission #biologicalapproach #techniquestostudythebrain \n**aim:** to find how dopamine affects being in love (?)\n**procedure:**\n- sample: 10 men and 7 women who were currently \"intensely in love\" but not with each other, recruited by volunteering. mean age was 21 and mean duration of being in love was 7 months\n- all participants went under an fMRI and engaged in a standardised procedure of looking at photos while their brains were scanned. there were four stages:\n\t- for 30 seconds, each participant viewed a photo of their loved one\n\t- 40 second filler activity which was to count back from a given number\n\t- 30 more seconds participants viewed a pot of an emotionally neutral acquaintance\n\t- final stage was 20 seconds of counting back from a given number\n- these steps were repeated 6 times, so the total procedure lasted 720 seconds (12 minutes)\n**findings:**\n- specific pattern of activation in the brains of participants in response to the photographs of their loved ones; activation was observed in dopamine-rich neural systems, primarily the VTA and caudate nucleus\n- both VTA and caudate nucleus are rich in dopamine and form the key part of the so-called copaminergic pathway - a system that generates and transmits dopamine, and increases dopamine activity in the brain\n- reward system, dopaminergic activity is associated with motivation and feelings of pleasure (romantic love??)\n**conclusions:**\n- inferred that dopamine plays a role in love\n**strengths:**\n**weaknesses:** \n## SCHEELE et al 2012, Women\n#hormones #oxytocin #biologicalapproach \n**aim:** to find the role of oxytocin in promoting fidelity in humans\n**procedure:** \n- 86 heterosexual men, some of which were single and some were in a stable monogomous relationship\n- double-blind independent measures design\n- \u003cu\u003etask one:\u003c/u\u003e subjects positions at the end of a room while an \"attractive\" female experimenter was positioned on the other side. subject was required to move slowly towards the female experimenter and stop at a distance that made him feel slightly uncomfortable/too close\n- \u003cu\u003etask two:\u003c/u\u003e subjects viewed a series of pictures on a screen 50cm away from them, each picture was shown for 2secs each. four kinds of pictures were shown: positive social, negative social, positive non-social, and negative non-social. all participants had a joystick, and if they liked the picture they were asked to pull the joystick which resulted in an increase of the pictures size/vice versa with disliked images (simulation of approach or avoidance)\n- IV - oxytocin/placebo intranasally administered\n- DV - how far men stood away from female researcher/how close or far the images were placed \n**findings:**\n- \u003cu\u003etask one:\u003c/u\u003e non-single males with oxytocin dose stood further away from women (avg of 71cm) while single males on oxytocin dose were barely affected\n- \u003cu\u003etask two:\u003c/u\u003e only groups of pictures affected by oxytocin and relationship status was the positive social group (attractive women pics); specifically, participants in a relationship who had oxytocin had slower reaction time in response to pictures\n**conclusions:**\n- oxytocin caused men in a relationship to \"stay away from\" an attractive woman who was not his partner\n- oxytocin selectively inhibits approach to certain stimuli (attractive women) in men who are in a stable relationship, but not in single men\n- oxytocin plays a role in fidelity\n**strengths:**\n- double blind, indepdendent measures\n**weaknesses:** \n## DE DREU et al 2012, prisoner's dilemma\n#oxytocin #biologicalapproach #hormones \n**aim:** to investigate the effect of oxytocin on inter-group conflict and out-group conflicts\n**procedure:**\n- double-blind experiment\n- independent measures design\n- sample of 102 males\n- self administed a dose of oxytocin or a placebo through nasal spray\n- participants were randomly assigned to 3 person groups and told they would need to compete against another group of 3\n- each person was paired with a member of another 3 person group, and they played a modified version of \"prisoner's dilemma\" (that one game between cooperating/not cooperating and you gain/lose points)\n- payoffs from the game was converted to real money and given to the participants\n**findings:**\n- a player's defence-motivated non-cooperation\n\t- is more likely if vulnerability of the player's group is high \n\t- does not depend so much on the player's own vulnerability\n\t- is more likely in the oxytocin condition\n**conclusions:**\n- oxytocin-induced non-cooperation is motivated by the desire to protect vulnerable group members, and not so much the desire to protect oneself\n- reinforces the role of oxytocin in creation bonds with members of your ingroup\n- shows that oxytocin can have a reverse, negative side in creating defensiveness and non-cooperation with others\n**strengths:**\n**weaknesses:** \n\n## WEDEKIND et al 1995, sweaty t-shirts\n#pheromones #biologicalapproach #evolution \n**aim:** to test whether a female will rate a sweaty t-shirt as more attractive if it is from a man with different immune system genes to her own\n**procedure:**\n- 49 females and 44 males tested for immune system genes (MHC)\n- males asked to wear a plain white t-shirt for 2 days\n- t-shirts then put in closed boxes until females were asked to smell them\n- females asked to rate the t-shirts for pleasantness and sexiness\n**findings:**\n- women rated the t-shirts as more pleasant and sexy if they came from a man with different MHC genes\n**conclusions:**\n- people are more motivated to find a mate with different immune system genes so their offspring will have stronger immune systems\n- also concluded body odour, not pheromones, is an important element of sociosexual behaviour\n**strengths:** \n- has been successfully replicated\n- double blind experiment\n- met ethical standards\n- well controlled; ensured that it was the odor being smelt and nothing else\n- ecologically valid(?)\n**weaknesses:** \n- \n## ZHOU et al 2014, stick figure\n#pheromones #biologicalapproach \n**aim:** to see the effect of AND and EST on heterosexual and homosexual men and women\n**procedure:**\n- sample was four groups of healthy non-smokers, including 24 hetero males, 24 hetero females, 24 homo males and 24 bi/homo females\n- participants watched stick figures walking on a screen and were asked to guess the gender of the stick figure\n- while watching, participants were exposed to the smell of cloves. in experimental condition, the cloves were mixed with AND; in control only cloves were used\n**findings:**\n- when het females and homo men were exposed to AND they had a higher rate of identifying the stick figure as \"masculine\" than the control group\n- AND had no significant effect on het men or homo women\n**conclusions:**\n- AND and EST may have some effect on human sexual behaviour\n**strengths:**\n- highly standardised procedure, easy to replicate\n- sample allowed for differences in sexuality\n- all participants were exposed to female version of AND, which was EST, and similar results were explained for het males but not as strongly for homo females\n- counter-balanced to control order effects\n**weaknesses:** \n- levels of AND and EST presented were much higher than the natural amount present in humans (questionable ecological validity)\n\n## CASPI et al 2003, 5-HTT\n#depression #biologicalapproach #genetics \n**aim:** to determine whether there is evidence for a gene-environment interaction for a mutation of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTT).\n**procedure:**\n- natural experiment (IV is natually occuring), longitudinal study\n- sample: 847 New Zealand 26 year olds, who had been assessed for mental health every other year until they were 21\n- divided into 3 groups based on their 5-HTT alleles:\n\t- group 1: 2 short alleles, homozygous (recessive)\n\t- group 2: 1 long + 1 short allele, heterozygous\n\t- group 3: 2 long alleles, homozygous\n- mutation of the 5-HTT gene has shorter allele\n- participants asked to fill in a \"stressful life events\" questionare, asking them about the frequency of 14 different events including financial, employment, health and relationship stressors between the ages of 21-26\n- they were assessed for depression too (method triangulation)\n**findings:**\n- people who had inherited one or more of the short alleles (group 1 and 2) demonstrated more symptoms of depression in response to stressful life events\n- the effect was strongest for those with 3 or more stressful life events (environment factor)\n- inheriting the gene alone was \u003cu\u003enot\u003c/u\u003e enough to lead to depression, but the genes' interaction with these events increased one's likelihood of developing depression\n**conclusions:**\n**strengths:**\n**weaknesses:** \n## WEISSMAN et al 2005, MDD kinship\n#majordepressivedisorder #biologicalapproach #genetics #kinshipstudy #geneticsimilarity\n**aim:** to investigate the potential genetic nature of Major Depressive Disorder\n**procedure:**\n- longitudinal kinship study taking place over 20 years\n- original sample was depressed grandparents, and the control group were selected from local community\n- data collected from clinicians, blind to past diagnosis of depression and data from previous interviews\n**findings:**\n- 59.2% of grandchildren with family history of MDD were showing signs of a psychiatric disorder by 12 years old\n- children had increased risk of any disorder if depression was observed in both the grandparents and parents, compared to children whose parents did not have depression\n- the severity of a parent's depression was correlated with an increased rate of mood disorder in the children\n- if a parent was depressed, but there was no history of depression in the grandparents, there was no significant effect of parental depression on the grandchildren\n**conclusions:**\n**strengths:**\n- researcher triangulation used\n- children were evaluated by both a child psychiatrist and another psychologist\n- single-blind (researchers unaware of MDD history)\n**weaknesses:** \n- no actual genotype was studied\n- correlational\n- small sample size\n## KENDLER et al 2006 MDD twins\n#genetics #twinstudy #biologicalapproach #majordepressivedisorder \n**aim:** three aims...\n1.  Past studies suggest a 35-45% heritability of major depression. Would this be true in a large Swedish sample? \n2.  Are there significant gender differences in the heritability of major depression? \n3.  Is there evidence that genetic and environmental factors in major depression differ over time?\n**procedure:**\n- sample: 15,493 complete twin pairs listed in the Swedish Twin Registry, only twins whose zygosity could be verified were used in the study.\n- Researchers used a team of trained interviewers to carry out telephone interviews between 1998 and 2003. The interviewers assessed lifetime major depression using modified DSM-IV criteria \n- 8056 twins met the criteria for diagnosis of MDD at some point in their life\n- interviewers also asked questions about the twins “shared environment” and their “individual specific environment\"\n**findings:**\n**![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/KZVzXuglvIxmQVLeGR7eJ73yIPycX1u0Gv_jIVcze5q9Aonv0eskPCGzr2iUK1IG775kUzfqLyd26s5c--LCK9XBBwNg9IHSSavm_Y1QUmYrwVVxcMf6M3RZ4dcSgiC6ntDdqhWiss8iYiRljpJmCfaD2A=s2048)\n- concordance rates for MDD were significantly higher in women than men\n- significantly higher in MZ twins than DZ twins\n- no correlation between number of years twins had lived together and MDD\n- estimated heritability of MDD was 0.348, in line with previous research\n- no significant differences in role of genetic and environmental factors in MDD\n**conclusions:**\n- suggests heritability of MDD is higher in women than men, and that some genetic risk factors are sex-specific\n**strengths:**\n- confirms previous research, strengthening the reliability of the findings\n**weaknesses:** \n- correlational\n- large sample size\n- self-reported\n## BUSS 1989, mate selection\n#biologicalapproach #evolution \n**aim:** to test three evolution-based assumptions about human mate selection: \n1. as men are searching for women with high reproductive value, they will favour youth and physical appearance\n2. as woman are searching for men who will invest in their offspring, they will favour a man with the resources he can provide\n3. as men do not want to invest in another man's child, abstinence will be highly valued\n**procedure:**\n- 37 samples taken from 33 countries, total of 10k participants\n- each sample completed two surveys; the first collected biographical data asking participants what age they prefer to marry at, their preferred age difference between themselves and their spouse, who should be older in a couple and how many children they want\n- they then rated 18 characteristics on a 4-point scale on how important they think they are\n- second survey provided 13 characteristics that participants were asked to rank in terms of desirability in a mate\n**findings:**\n- in 36/37 samples, women valued \"good financial prospects\" in a potential mate more than males did\n- in all samples, men preferred mates who are younger, with an average age of 24.83 (close to the peak female fertility age)\n- 34/37 samples showed that males value physical attractiveness in potential mates more than females do\n- only 23/37 samples valued chastity\n**conclusions:**\n- proved the first two points correct, but not the third\n**strengths:**\n**weaknesses:** \n- low temporal (time) validity; done many decades ago and social norms have changes\n- uses etic approach - meaning that it is rooted in the culture of the researcher, other cultures might not put such significance on these specific aspects\n## ROGERS AND KESNER 2003, rats in maze\n#animalmodels #neurotransmission #rmofbiologicalapproach #antagonist \n**aim:** to determine the role of acetylcholine in the formation of spatial memory\n**procedure:**\n- had 30 rats acclimate to a maze by placing food in one of the corners\n- once the rats were familiar with the maze (and weren't afraid of it) they begun the experiment\n- rats were randomly allocated to one of two conditions; either injected with scopolamine (blocks acetylcholine receptor sites and inhibits response, antagonist) or saline solution (placebo) ten minutes before running the maze, with the injection made directly into the hippocampus\n- encoding memory was assessed by the average number of errors made on the first five trials of day 1 compared to the last five trials of day 1, whereas retrieval of memory was assessed by the average number of errors made on the first five trials of day 2 compared to the last five trials of day 1\n**findings:**\n- scopolamine group took longer and made more mistakes (had higher average number of mistakes on last five trials of day 1)\n- but, it did not have a significant effect on retrieval of memories \n**conclusions:**\n- acetylcholine may play an important role in the consolidation of spatial memory\n**strengths:**\n- used a placebo to avoid confounding variables\n- is able to establish cause and effect relationship\n**weaknesses:** \n- questionable whether it can be generalised to humans \n## ROMERO et al 2014, dogs\n#hormones #animalmodels #oxytocin \n**aim:** to investigate the role of oxytocin in social bonds between mammals in non-reproductive contexts\n**procedure:**\n- 16 dogs were sprayed intra-nasally with either oxytocin or a placebo (repeated measures, double-blind counterbalanced design)\n- placed with their owner and another dog in the same room, and their behaviour was recorded by 4 cameras in 1 hour\n- room was empty except for a chair where dog owner sat; owner was instructed to move the chair in pre-designated positions in every 10 minutes, but otherwise sit quietly and not interact with the dogs\n**findings:**\n- dogs sprayed with oxytocin showed higher affiliation towards owners\n- affiliation was operationalised as sniffing, licking, gentle touching with nose or paw, play bouts and body contact\n- dogs spent more time in close proximity to their owner\n- similar results observed for the dog partner (the other dog in the room)\n**conclusions:**\n- performs the function of maintaining close social bonds in mammals\n**strengths:**\n**weaknesses:** \n## MERZENICH 1984 monkey finger\n#neuroplasticity #animalmodels #corticalremapping\n**aim:** studied the cortical representation of the hand in eight adult owl monkeys\n**procedure:**\n- eight adult owl monkeys\n- sensory inputs from all the fingers were mapped in the cortex (electrodes inserted into cortical area known to be responsible for sensation from the hand, then researchers stimulated various areas on the fingers one by one and noted which electrode was responding. monkeys were anesthetised beforehand)\n- the middle finger on the monkey's hand was amputated\n- 62 days later a remapping was done to see how the cortical area responsible for sensitivity from the hand changed after amputation\n**findings:**\n- results of the first mapping showed that there were five distinct areas in the brain, each responsible for one finger, with adjacent fingers represented in adjacent areas in the cortex\n- after the finger was amputated, adjacent areas (responsible for sensitivity from digits 2 and 4) spread and occupied parts of the now unused (3) area\n- areas for 2 and 4 became larger while 1 and 5 stayed the same \n**conclusions:**\n- cortical remapping of sensory inputs from the hand occurs within 62 days in owl monkeys\n**strengths:**\n**weaknesses:** \n## GLANZER AND CUNITZ 1966, words msmm\n#multistoremodelofmemory #cognitiveapproach #modelsofmemory \n**aim:** to investigate whether the interval of time between words on a list would increase number of words recalled at the start of the list. (eg primacy vs recency)\n**procedure:**\n- sample: 240 army enlisted men\n- independent samples design\n- 40 men allocated to each condition:\n\t- words read once at 3sec rate\n\t- words read twice at 3sec rate\n\t- words read once at 6sec rate\n\t- words read twice at 6sec rate\n\t- words read once at 9sec rate\n\t- words read twice at 9sec rate\n- participants first given two 5-word practice lists so they could learn the procedure\n- listened to recordings of eight 20-word lists, lists were the same for each group\n- all words common one-syllable words\n- participants had two minutes to write down the words they recalled in any order\n**findings:**\n- increased time interval between words led to an increase in the recall of all words in the list except for those at the end\n- effect of repetition on recall was limited to 3sec rate\n- no significant effect on recall in the 6 or 9sec rates\n**conclusions:**\n- primacy is the result of rehearsal\n- increased time interval allowed for more rehearsal, thus greater overall recall of the list of words\n- however, words in the STM were still available in working memory, no significant change in frequency of recall\n- words at end of the list are not rehearsed as often and thus decay from STM\n- supports idea that LTM and STM are separate stores\n**strengths:**\n- standardised procedure\n- independent samples\n**weaknesses:** \n- low ecological validity \n\n## LANDRY AND BARTLING 2011, letters wmm\n#cognitiveapproach #workingmemorymodel #rmofcognitiveapproach #modelsofmemory \n**aim:** to investigate if articulatory suppression would influence the recall of a written list of phonologically dissimilar letters in serial recall.\n**procedure:**\n- sample: 34 undergrad psych students, individually tested\n- independent samples design\n- experimental group: participants saw a list of letters that they had to recall while saying the numbers 1 and 2 at a rate of two numbers per second (articulatory suppression task - so they couldn't say things out loud)\n- control group: saw letters but did not have to carry out articulatory suppression task\n- the letters shown were chosen because they do not sound similar\n- trials were repeated ten times\n- trials were scored as correct if the letters were in the correct position\n**findings:**\n- experimental group had much lower scores than control\n- mean percentage of accurate recall in control was 76% compared to 45% in experimental\n- standard deviation for both were nearly identical: 0.13 and 0.14\n**conclusions:**\n- articulatory suppression prevents rehearsal in the phonological loop because of Overload - thus, difficulty in memorising letter strings\n**strengths:**\n- easily replicable\n**weaknesses:** \n- lacks ecological validity\n## BRANSFORD AND JOHNSON 1972, topic schema\n#cognitiveapproach #schematheory #effortaftermeaning #modelsofmemory\n**aim:** to determine whether schema activation would result in a better understanding and recall of an ambiguous text.\n**procedure:**\n- sample: 52 participants\n- allocated to one of three conditions: **no topic** group (heard passage w no additional info), **topic after** group (told the topic of passage after hearing it), **topic before** group (told topic of passage before hearing it)\n- all participants listened to tape-recorded passage and were told that they would later be asked to recall the passage as accurately as possible\n- all tested at the same time, but had different booklets\n- given five minutes for recall\n- all also asked to rate comprehension on scale of 1-7\n**findings:**\n- no significant difference between no topic and topic after, but significantly higher number of \"ideas\" recalled for topic before group, and significantly higher comprehension too\n**conclusions:**\n- prior knowledge of a situation does not guarantee its usefulness for comprehension; for prior knowledge to aid comprehension, it must become an activated semantic context\n**strengths:**\n- independent samples\n- highly controlled\n**weaknesses:** \n- ecological validity, kinda artificial\n## ANDERSON AND PICHERT 1978, burglar homeowner\n#cognitiveapproach #modelsofmemory #schematheory \n**aim:** investigated the role of schema in the encoding and recall of a story\n**procedure:**\n- sample: 39 participants...all psych students...\n- the story had 72 discreet ideas: 15 related to a burglary, 13 related to purchasing a home\n- participants randomly allocated to \"robber\" or \"home buyer\" condition\n- given two minutes to **read** the story as their role, then given 12 minutes to take an 84-item vocab test (filler task)\n- then asked to write down as much of the story as they could\n- given five minutes for another filler\n- then asked to recall a second time: half were told to do from the same perspective they used in the first recall, half told to use the opposing perspective\n**findings:**\n- burglr info was recalled better than homebuyer info LOL may be because students do not have a well-developed homebuyer schema\n- group that had burglar perspective recalled more burglar info and homebuyers recalled more homebuyer info\n**conclusions:**\n- schema influenced encoding\n- schema influenced retrieval\n**strengths:**\n- highly controlled\n**weaknesses:** \n- artificial (ecological validity)\n- tiny sample\n- order effects? fatigue effects\n## LOFTUS AND PALMER 1974, cars\n#cognitiveapproach #rmofcognitiveapproach #reconstructivememory\n**aim:** to investigate the role of leading questions in influencing the estimation of speed\n**procedure:**\n- sample: 45 students, divided into five groups\n- 7 films of traffic accidents were shown with the length of the films ranging from 5-30secs\n- independent samples; each participant watched all 7 films\n- asked to give an account of the accident they had seen and answered a questionnaire with various questions: the critical question asking them to estimate the speed of the cards involved in the accident\n- all asked the same question but included different words for different groups: \"about how fast were the cars going when they ... each other\", replaced with hit, collided, bumped, smashed, contacted\n**findings:**\n- mean estimates of speed highest in \"smashed\" condition (40.8mph)\n- lowest in \"contacted\" (31.8mph)\n**conclusions:**\n- two conclusions:\n\t- response bias: participants uncertain about exact speed, and thus verbs like \"smashed\" biases their response to be higher\n\t- the wording of the question changed the mental representation of the accident; thus \"smashed\" activates cognitive schema of sever accident\n- participant's memory of an accident could be changed by using suggestive questions\n**strengths:**\n- confounding variables controlled\n**weaknesses:**\n- low ecological validity\n- students as sample = biased\n- students may not have driving experience, thus not representative of general population\n## YUILLE AND CUTSHALL 1986, crime\n#reconstructivememory #rmofcognitiveapproach #cognitiveapproach \n**aim:** to determine whether leading questions would affect the memory of eyewitnesses at a real crime scene. \n**procedure:**\n- crime scene; thief entered a gun shop and stole money and guns from shop. owner freed himself, went outside the shop, but the thief shot him. thief died after police arrived\n- 13 eyewitnesses agreed to be interviewed as part of a study\n- gave their account of the incident four months after the event, and were asked questions\n- two leading questions were used; half the group asked if they saw \"a\" broken headlight on the getaway car, half asked if they saw \"the\" broken headlight\n- there was no broken headlight\n- second question: \"the\" yellow panel vs \"a\" yellow panel \n- panel was actually blue\n- asked to rate their stress on the day of the event on a seven-point scale\n**findings:**\n- eyewitnesses very reliable\n- recalled a large amount of accurate detail confirmed by police reports\n- 10/13 said there was no broken headlight or yellow quarter panel/hadn't noticed these things\n**conclusions:**\n- contradicts loftus and palmer\n- could be that the lack of emotional response in l\u0026p played a key role in influence of leading question\n**strengths:**\n- naturalistic (?)\n- archival evidence to confirm accuracy of memories\n**weaknesses:** \n- not replicable\n- not generalisable\n## SHAROT ET AL 2007, 9/11\n#cognitiveapproach #flashbulbmemory #localisationoffunction #techniquestostudythebrain \n**aim:** to determine the potential role of biological factors on flashbulb memories.\n**procedure:** \n- sample: 24 participants, all were in nyc on the day of 9/11\n- recruited through advertisements\n- put into an fMRI\n- while in the scanner, presented with words on a screen - \"summer\" and \"september\" were included in order to have participants link the words to the events of 9/11 \n- brain activity observed as they recalled the event\n- participants then asked to rate their memories for vividness, detail, confidence in accuracy, and arousal\n- also asked to write a description of the memories\n**findings:**\n- half of the participants reported having a \"flashbulb memory\", and those who did reported that they were closer to the world trade centre - they also provided more specific details\n- activation of amygdala for those closer to the event was higher recalling the events of 9/11 than the event of the preceding summer, whereas those further away from the event had similar activation of the amygdala between the two events\n**conclusions:**\n- close personal experience may be critical in the process of creating flashbulb memories\n**strengths:**\n- no demand characteristics!\n**weaknesses:** \n- highly artificial thus low ecological validity\n- small sample size, culturally biased\n- correlational\n## NEISSER AND HARSCH 1992, the challenger\n#rmofcognitiveapproach #cognitiveapproach #flashbulbmemory \n**aim:** to determine whether flashbulb memories are susceptible to distortion.\n**procedure:**\n- sample: 106 -\u003e 44 university psychology students\n- taking place the morning after the Challenger disaster, they were given a questionnaire on the events, asking questions such as \"where were you\" and \"how did you hear about it\"\n- 2 and 1/2 years later, they were given the same questionnaire, and then also asked about how accurate they thought their memory was (1-5)\n- then a few months later, an interview was held \n**findings:**\n- after comparing the initial responses to the questionnaire to the one completed 2 1/2 years later, it was found that out of the 7 \"content\" questions, there was a large discrepancy amongst most participants - only 3 had their questionnaires completely match up\n**conclusions:**\n- suggests that flashbulb memories aren't as reliable as they can still be manipulated after\n**strengths:**\n- method triangulation - both questionnaires and interviews used\n- high ecological validity\n**weaknesses:** \n- cannot be replicated\n- possible demand characteristics\n## GRIGGS AND COX 1982, Wason selection\n#cognitiveapproach #thinkingsystems #dualprocessingmodel \n**aim:** to see if matching bias was less commonly used to solve the Wason Selection task when the task was more personally relevant\n**procedure:**\n- sample: 144 undergrad psych students, randomly allocated to 6 groups\n- three tasks were completed (in varying order)\n- abstract task: letters and numbers\n- intermediate: colour of shirt and age\n- memory cueing: drink and age\n**findings:**\n- abstract task: 3% solved correctly\n- intermediate: 43% solved correctly\n- memory cueing: 60% solved correctly\n- when task cued memory of past experience, rational approach was used\n- more abstract and less relevant, more likely cognitive biases were used\n**conclusions:**\n- matching bias less commonly used when task was more personally relevant\n- when task is not abstract, 75% are able to correctly solve the problem, showing that system1 works well\n**strengths:**\n- has been replicated with similar results\n- repeated measures + counterbalancing\n**weaknesses:** \n- highly artificial, thus low ecological validity\n- sampling bias (psych students)\n## ENGLICH AND MUSSWEILER 2001, judges\n#biasesinthinkinganddecisionmaking #cognitivebiases #cognitiveapproach #dualprocessingmodel #anchoringbias\n**aim:** to determine the effect of a prosecutor's suggestion for sentencing on the decision-making of a judge.\n**procedure:**\n- sample: 19 young trial judges (independent samples), little experience\n- given a case of alleged rape, participants were given case materials and asked to read through and form an opinion. after, they were given a questionnaire - half were told the prosecutor demanded 34 months sentences and other half were told 2 month sentence\n- then asked questions about their recommended sentence, how certain they were, and how realistic they thought the case was\n**findings:**\n- judges reported low certainty levels\n- 2 months: avg sentence was 18ish months\n- 34 months: 28ish months\n**conclusions:**\n- anchoring bias is present\n- given a lower demand for months sentenced, judges were more inclined to give a lower sentence etc\n**strengths:**\n- advice was sought from highly experienced trial judges\n- case material tested on senior law students (pilot group) - avg was 17ish months\n**weaknesses:** \n- independent samples = participant variability = confounding variables\n- small sample size\n## TVERSKY AND KAHNEMANN 1974, multiplication\n#biasesinthinkinganddecisionmaking #cognitivebiases #cognitiveapproach #anchoringbias \n**aim:** to investigate the effects of anchoring bias on the estimation of an equation\n**procedure:**\n- sample: high school students\n- half were shown the equation 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 x 7 x 8\n- other half were shown 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 \n- asked to quickly estimate the value\n**findings:**\n- those who were shown the \"ascending\" equation estimated a lower mean (512) than those who were shown the \"descending\" equation (2250)\n**conclusions:**\n- since equations are read left to right, the first number is used as an anchor and thus those who had \"1\" would estimate lower than \"8\"\n**strengths:**\n- easily replicated\n**weaknesses:** \n- low ecological validity\n## SPARROW 2011, google effect\n#cognitiveapproach #digitaltechnologyandcognitiveprocessing \n#googleeffect\n**aim:** to investigate the effects of technology on cognition\n**procedure:**\n- sample: sixty undergraduate students at Harvard\n- asked to type 40 facts into a computer, some were well known and some were more surprising\n- 2x2 independent samples design; half were told the data could be saved into the computer, half were told that it would be erased. half were told to remember the information, half were not (four separate conditions in total)\n- asked to recall as many facts as they could in 10 minutes\n- then given a recognition task to see if they could recall which facts were shown\n**findings:**\n- asking to remember the information made no significant difference on how well they remembered\n- but there was a significant difference in recollection on those who were told the information would be saved vs those who were told the information would be erased\n- those who were told the information would be saved did not remember as many facts as the others\n**conclusions:**\n- google effect is real; if one knows that information is stored elsewhere they will make less effort to store and remember the information\n**strengths:**\n- ????\n**weaknesses:** \n- replications of this study have provided results that contradict sparrow's, thus the validity of this study can be questioned\n- low ecological validity - these facts are trivia, and may not be important to participants\n## ASCH 1956, conformity Lines\n#conformity #socioculturalapproach #socialidentitytheory\n**aim:** to investigate the influence of normative social influence on one's likelihood to conform in an unambiguous task\n**procedure:**\n- 123 male students in the USA, told that they were undertaking a vision test (deception)\n- IV: unanimous incorrect response\n- DV: level of conformity (agreeing with incorrect response)\n- naive participant + six participants\n- presented a line, and asked to say out loud the line number they thought matches the length of the original line\n- confederates asked to sometimes say the incorrect answer\n- interviews carried out after the experiment\n**findings:**\n- 75% participants conformed at least once\n- during interviews, multiple reasons for conforming were given:\n\t- thought that they were wrong\n\t- unsure of their answer\n\t- didn't want to be ridiculed by the group\n**conclusions:**\n- even though many participants thought they were right, they changed their behaviour to match everyone else's. suggests that people conform and comply with majority\n**strengths:**\n- used a control group, where only the participant was present with no confederates\n- easily replicable\n**weaknesses:** \n- low ecological validity\n- biased sample\n## DRURY ET AL 2009, vr manchester trains \n#socialidentitytheory #socioculturalapproach \n**aim:** to investigate the role of social identity theory in pro-social behaviour.\n**procedure:** \n- sample; 40 students, age 20-25\n- independent samples\n- used vr simulator to simulate the london metro, needing to escape a fire\n- they could push people out of the way or help people\n- participants were primed by either being given a scenario about watching a football game and going home with other fans (in-group) or going shopping alone and going home (no in-group)\n**findings:**\n- those with the in-group identification were more likely to help others than those who did not have in-group identification\n**conclusions:**\n- altruistic behaviour is more likely to be shown when one has a strong in-group identification towards those within the same group\n**strengths:**\n- replicable, showing reliability of results\n- ethical, does not cause undue stress or harm etc\n**weaknesses:** \n- ecological validity; using vr may not be realistic and participants did not feel like they were in danger\n## BANDURA 1961, bobo dolls\n#socioculturalapproach #socialcognitivetheory \n**aim:** to investigate whether children could learn aggressive behaviours by watching the behaviour of adults\n**procedure:**\n- 72 young boys and girls, using matched pairs of aggressiveness levels\n- put into a room with toys and a bobo (inflatable) doll\n- control group: no model, group exposed to aggressive model, group exposed to passive model\n- another variable was whether the model was the same sex as the participants or not\n- stage one: in non-aggressive condition, model quietly played with blocks, in aggressive condition, model was aggressive towards the doll\n- stage two: mild aggression arousal; children were told they couldn't play with the toys\n- stage three: brought to a room with the choice of non-aggressive and aggressive toys, children were observed through a one-way mirror\n**findings:**\n- aggressive condition made more aggressive acts than non-aggressive condition\n- boys made more aggressive acts than girls, and boys with a male model made more aggressive acts than boys with a female model\n**conclusions:**\n- children can learn aggressive behaviours, especially when the model is more similar to them (same sex)\n**strengths:**\n- matched pairs, controlling more variables\n- also provides evidence for the motivation factor of SCT\n**weaknesses:** \n- ethical concerns, undue stress or harm, consent\n- small sample size\n- lacks ecological validity\n## JOY, KIMBALL \u0026 ZABRACK 1986, video games and violence\n#socialcognitivetheory #socioculturalapproach \n**aim:** to investigate the impact of television on children's aggressive behaviour by carrying out a longitudinal natural experiment\n**procedure:**\n- conducted in three small towns in Canada, where television was recently introduced\n- psychologists observed both physical and verbally aggressive behaviour displayed by elementary school children on the playground a year before a television channel was accessible, and then two years after the channel was accessible\n- 120 children in the sample\n- teacher and peer ratings of aggressive behaviour and information about television viewing habits were obtained\n**findings:**\n- aggressive behaviour in this town increased significantly after the introduction of the television channel\n**conclusions:**\n- television had an impact on the level of aggression shown by children, due to heightened arousal obtained when watching television\n**strengths:**\n- \n- data triangulation\n**weaknesses:** \n- internal validity was low - many uncontrolled variables\n- may not be reliable, difficult to generalise","lastmodified":"2023-10-16T21:39:49.173247918Z","tags":null},"/notes/psych/psychology":{"title":"psychology","content":"[[notes/psych/key studies|key studies]] \n[[notes/psych/how to
